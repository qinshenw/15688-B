5 I wish I lived in Chinatown, just to be closer to Wah Fung. If I were in the area, I honestly would never cook -- I'd just walk over here for lunch every day, and eat bbq roast pork and Peking duck to my heart's content.   Lucky for my heart and arteries, then, that I'm not in this area. Sad for my stomach, though, because this is honestly one of my favorite places to eat in the city.  As others have noted, this is a CASH ONLY restaurant, so be sure to have some money on you! And, if you're anything like me and get a little too excited when you're here, have a bit more cash on hand than you originally anticipated spending, because once you're inside and can smell the food, you will want absolutely everything.
4 My cousin really wanted to eat here since everyone raves about it. For the price you definitely get a good portion. I couldnt even finish mine. I see why everyone loves it. Its juicy and very flavorful!
4 Wah Fung is not the most elegant dining establishment but they offer well made, delicious, Chinese deli meats over rice with a side of cabbage and sauce (make sure you get the ginger sauce!) at very reasonable prices.   The meat is tender and with just enough fat to make it juicy.  I grew up with this type of food and often eat it at meals while growing up.  They offer roast pork, roast chicken legs, BBQ pork and roast duck.   Orders can be placed for small or large portions, with one meat or multiple meats, and with or without rice and cabbage.   If you plan to eat it immediately I suggest ordering the rice, which will soak up the soy based sauce and the ginger scallion sauce and balance out the saltiness.  Don't be fooled -they give plenty of food, even for a small order, and pack the container to its maximum capacity.  A small is plenty for one person.  There is no seating inside and one often sees a line snaking out the door (it moves pretty fast).  There are a lot of signs on the wall and they can be confusing but they all pretty much cover how many meats you want, which meats, with or without rice/cabbage and size.   The prices are ridiculously reasonable.  I only wish they served breast meat for the chicken but I'm not going to complain too much about that.  What they offer is quite good as is.
5 CHEAP. FILLING. GO.   if you like meat and carbs, treat yourself to this place because the meat is SO juicy and delicious. you won't regret it.
5 I've had this place bookmarked for years and never got the chance to go until one random weekday! Of course I've heard so many great things that I had to come see it for myself. Thankfully there wasn't a line even! I got the roast pork everyday special for lunch and brought it to Washington Square park to eat. It was so mouthwatering good! Could not believe it was only for $4!!! Too good to be true! There's so much food given too that there were enough leftovers to feed me for the rest of the day. I need to come back and try the other BBQ delicacies!
5 Holy crap. How do you get this much food (and pretty quality taste) for only $4? Only in Chinatown. The char siu pork was nicely crisp and sweet on the outside and packed with flavor. The rice itself was alright, but tasted great when it soaked up the golden liquid of the pork and the ladle of soup that they pour into the bowl. The steamed cabbage is also a great palate cleanser when the meal becomes just a bit too fatty.  This bowl of goodness is actually addicting, as I was immediately craving for more after finishing. Definitely hit this jewel up when walking pass Chinatown and enjoy your meal fresh in the park nearby.  I can't agree enough with all the YouTubers and reviews that highlight this place - still a gem!
5 Hands down my favorite take out in NYC, out of all the places ive been this place has been consistently delicious throughout the years
5 BEST FOOD EVER. Thats all. I dare someone to find me something so delicious for such a low price. I take on all challengers.
4 A 15 minute wait is about average in the PM when I go. I've been coming here for years and usually just get a 1/2 Lb of the roast pork. They have a super $4 special with chicken or pork and noodle or rice and some cabbage. You can also get the proteins by weight. Usually roast duck, roast pork, or roast chicken.  Always good and once in a while fantastic. It's always luck of the draw. Sometimes you get a piece with the right fat content sometimes you don't. Get a drink at the corner deli and eat in the park across the street. Usually there is a Mister softee off the corner of the park and you can round off your meal for under 10 bucks including desert!
5 DELICIOUS The food is definitely worth the price. The small portions are $3.50-4 and the large ones are about $6. They stuffed my box to the brim with a generous amount of meat that comes with steamed Chinese cabbage and rice. I highly recommend the pork (I also got the chicken but preferred the pork).  One thing to note is that there aren't any seats inside. You could eat at the park across the street, but definitely plan ahead for where you're going to sit!
5 If you want to talk about hole-in-the-wall, this little gem in Chinatown epitomizes awesome authentic Chinese food at equally palatable prices.  I was craving BBQ duck when I was visiting NYC (I always am craving it actually). Found this place on Yelp, and boy, was I glad and I ended up coming back every time I was in NYC.   There is no sit-in. This is purely for take-outs, cash only. Very typical of authentic hole-in-the-wall places. You also know it's good when everyone who lines up outside their place speaks Chinese.  The food is amazing. Very flavorful and just the right amount of sweetness. $4 for a small rice with pork or chicken. I always rolled with a $6 large two items - pork and duck. Service is pretty quick too, because these guys are skilled with their blades and could get your order out before you could even thank them for the order. This place deserves a Michelin star from me.
5 I can't wait to come back here! It's a hole in the wall with no seating but the food is incredible. My friend and I got here as it was about to close but we managed to snag the last large chicken and rice box. It was delicious. I can only imagine how amazing the pork and duck tastes!
5 This is a no-frills Chinese bbq meats shop that sells hot meals for takeout only (almost like an indoor food truck). Meat over rice is the tried and trued formula. I ordered the roast bbq pork and chicken over rice and it was deliciously filling. Heads up: the bbq pork is really fatty (more so than any other version of the dish I've tasted) and they are quite stingy with the cabbage.
5 I went in to this shop blind and had no idea what to expect. The shop is pretty small with a small, but straighforward menu. The shop has an atmosphere that of a butcher shop, which is pretty appealing. Though the shop is small, the line gets long fast. When asking my friends their recommendations it was a consensus to get the roast pork. I got the small with rice and we went to the park across the street to enjoy it. The pork was cooked perfectly and flavor fantastic. The rice was the perfect warmth and moisture for the weather. This place will not disappoint.
5 Saw a this place with a line out the door and knew we had to stop in for whatever they were serving up.  The sign on the door read "roast chicken or pork with small rice and vegetable... $4.00"  So, obviously we got that with the pork.  There's no where to sit so grab your food and go sit in the park across the street to eat it.   All I want to do today is go back and eat more it was sooo delicious. Nothing fancy here just damn good food and fast service. So if you find yourself in Chinatown needing a quick delicious bite to eat, wait in line and get yourself some!  Did I mention I'm still dreaming and salivating over the pork?
4 Mmmmm. I went to NY for 4 days and stopped by here twice! The first time we went, we ordered a large roast pork (it's a must-have) and a combo of cha sew, and duck. Maybe I shouldn't have bit into the roast pork first before trying the other dish, because man..that pork was soooooooooooo good. Like why don't we have something like that in SF? It was fatty, juicy, tender...it was practically melting in my mouth and then that skin? That shock of still crunchy-not-soggy skin! Omg...   Well, of course, nothing can be compared to the roast pork. The cha sew was cut on the thick side but still a little better than the duck. Duck had all these bones and barely any meat. But the sauce they drizzle on everything was yummy and salty too.   I was also happy to see cabbage. Probably the only time I had veggies in my entire trip to NY.
5 If I lived in New York, I would legitimately eat this every day. EVERY DAY!!! The serving size for the pricing is unreal for NYC, and this is the Chinese version of comfort food. I spent $6 on a large combo of both duck and roast pork- I couldn't choose just one of the proteins with my first visit, but if I were to go again, I think I would just go for their pork. Don't get me wrong, their duck isn't bad, but it definitely isn't the best pork I've ever had. All of their dishes come with a heaping of white rice, choice of protein, and some cabbage.   Some other important notes: they take CASH ONLY, and it's a take out place- no space to eat inside after grabbing your food, but there is a park across the street with benches to sit at if you can't wait to get home with your food!
5 This place will always be an awesome option. Where else in NYC can you have a full meal with leftovers for less than 10$?! Well here you can - you'll spend about 4.50$ if you get a small portion, and a 5.50$/6$ if you get a large.   A portion of what, you might ask: simple white rice topped with a meat if your choice among char siu pork, roasted chicken, roasted duck, or roasted pig, with a side of cooked cabbage.   Just FYI: one large potion will be enough for two, unless you actually want leftovers (like we did).   The char siu pork is flavorful, juicy, and always nice and tender. The chicken is honestly some of the best I've had, regardless of the price.   The roasted duck is delicious: crispy skin, juicy meat. But my absolute favorite has to be the roasted pig. Anytime I go and get a classic platter O end up getting a pound of roasted pig to go.   What you'll get is tender juicy pork, with crispy skin on top (yes the crispy delicious rind) - and you'll only pay 9$ for a whole pound. Who wouldn't want some to go???   You can also choose to have it over rice - so you can't miss out on it.   If you've never been here, trust me, you need to make your way to it ASAP. You'll definitely thank me (and your stomach and wallet will too).
3 Came here with very high expectations and was slightly disappointed. I was really look forward to having the roasted pig or the chicken, and they were out of both when I visited. I ended up going with the pork, which was pretty good, but not my favorite.   However, there are a few positives that stand out. As far as value, portions are large and the price is unbeatable. The restaurant itself is tiny with lines out the door, but the service is very fast.  Overall, I don't regret coming here, but wouldn't go out of my way to come back. Stop by if you're in the area.
4 Tender cha siu and siu yook. I don't think I've ever had such tender roast pork belly while still being able to enjoy the crispy skin. A small two meat combo is $4.50 but if you just get roast pork or chicken it's $4 based on the sign outside.  I recommend asking them to hold the "sauce" aka the soup from the meats because it makes your rice really soggy. If you're into that by all means, enjoy it how they prepare it. The cabbage is a nice touch though it's mush.  Small shop. No seats. Quick service. Cash only. Know what you want by the time you order. It's a small menu so shouldn't be too hard!
1 I am horrified this place is still open after the health dept shut them down a few times over the years!. I have even bumped into friends and neighborhood cops waiting on this line and have tried to warn them... If you knew the truth you would RUN from this place. What you don't see beyond the cheap prices and glazed bbq is how they prep and handle the food from hanging in a rusted dusty basement dungeon, hanging it outdoors with no sanitary pans and mice and roaches of all sizes everywhere. I KNOW this because I worked in the building for quite some time. While I'm all about mom and pop shops in today's age of gentrified neighborhoods and I am a Chinese native in this area for over 30 years, this business should not be operating and if you had access to the stairwell just next door of them to see their basement and yard, you would see the truth. If I still had access, I would have provided photos but anyone with access to the building would see this. They even kept a poor diseased cat who had infected eyes and a bad limp in this area of the basement, running really hot down there. One day they saw me trying to rescue it but it got away in another locked room down there, and the next day the cat was gone and never seen again for the next few months, when it used to be there every day with no escape to the outdoors. Horrified at this place.
5 Spent a weekend exploring Chinatown and stumbled upon this spot for a quick bite. I was drawn in by the line out the door and Im glad I decided to give them a try. The food was delicious, hot and out fast and for a whopping $5.50 for a large, cant beat it! I ordered the pork on rice with vegetables and it isn't a fancy meal but its all about the flavor! The sign outside of the shop reads #1 fast food for good reason. Id gladly come back next time I'm in the city and try out the duck over rice.
5 This is a small takeout place (no seating) which offers delicious Chinese roasted meats (Roast pork, Roast duck, Soy sauce chicken, and Roast Pig) at bargain prices. You can take your order and sit in the park across the street to eat.  You will notice many Asians in standing in line here so you know this is the real deal in both quality, quantity, and price/value. No tourist trap here!  The small order of roast meat over rice with steamed cabbage is $4 and the large order is $6.50. If your someone with a big appetite then I would suggest the large portion. Small or large portion they pack it with a generous amount of meat. They also offer combination platters for you to mix and match your selection of barbequed meats.  I love to get lunch at this place when I'm strolling around near Chinatown. So good .. you will love this place.
5 I love the place! The roast pig is everything! The duck is so good! Always a line! The prices are less then 5.00 dollars!  Going tomorrow because it is closed on Monday!
5 I've been dying to try this place since seeing so many reviews on it. I finally made my way to NY from Cali and this was one of my first stops. I was expecting the line to be long, but it wasn't too many people in front of me. It was however moving a little slow. I realized there were 3 visible workers. One guy was in the back making the rice and cabbage I assume because he brought some out as I was leaving. One guy was taking orders and preparing your order for you. The last guy was literally just standing there, he mixed the rice a few times and that was it. Anyways, I got the small roast pork over rice and it was amazing. Plenty of rice and good flavorful meat. The price was very cheap for all that you get. No seating in the building, but a park across the street with benches.
4 Went here to grab a quick bite to eat on a weekend. I arrived around 12:15pm on a Sunday and there was barely a line and then literally 10 minutes later there were about 20 people waiting behind me.  I decided to get a small duck and pork--needless to say, the pork is what you come here for--it was so sweet and tender and delicious. The duck had good flavor, but it was a little riddled with bones--not my cup of tea.  Overall, the whole meal was $4.50--quite a steal.
4 After try many place in China town, my stomach was full and I still want to try out this place. We order small side rice with two different kind of meat for $4.50. Since, we full I ask him just give me little rice. But he still give me lot. Their steam rice is little soggy.  I have roasted duck, is good but little salty for me. Roast pork, is good, well marinate but I like the most is roasted pig. This place doesn't have chair or table, but they have a park across the street. Just order togo, then walk across and enjoy your meal.
5 Small hole in the wall Chinese place that has only a few items on the menu but has very good quality.  Tre place is so small that the people trying it leave barely have enough room to squeeze by the people trying to get I. To order.    We got a small order worth two meats.  It comes with rice and cabbage and we picked pork and duck.  We asked if hey could throw in a few pieces of the roasted pork so we could try it out with having to order a full serving and they did.  The rice and cabbage were ok. It he meats were excellent.  I really liked both of the poor options.  One was like a nice sweet tangy roast where the flavor isn't just on the outside but was started to seep I. Tot he meat and the other was like a roasted pork belly where the skin is crispy and crunchy.  This place is really good for the limited items they offer but that's what makes it a good go to place, plus they aren't that expensive
4 Growing up in Chinatown/Little Italy, this was our spot. Roast pork w sautéed cabbage over white rice $3. Super tasty sauce, flavorful veggies and addictive glaze.  With all the reviews done on tv over the past few years the place has blown up and is not a best kept secret. It hasn't been for a while. As it's a take out hole in the wall be ready for a 10-15 min wait on good days.   Bring a friend to hold your spot on line. Pop in next door and get 10 dumpling for $3 to nosh on while you wait.  Wah Fung - In!
4 i love meat but felt kinda sick after
4 I've been their customer since their humble beginnings as a noodle cart just two blocks away from their current storefront location. I would stand in line behind 10+ customers just for their noodles + fishballs because it was that delicious. The business was operated by a couple: the husband was responsible for pulling out noodles & fishballs and the wife would be in charge of adding finishing touches and cash handling. There were plenty of noodle carts around Chinatown, but this was considered the best and the consistent lines proved it. The Wah Fung couple hustled hard and used the money that they have saved over the years to open their first storefront and named it "Wah Fung No 1 Fast Food."  Rewind to 2018 and some things still haven't changed. I'm still waiting in line behind 10+ customers for delicious and inexpensive food the Wah Fung couple has to offer. This time they focus on roast pork, roast pig, chicken, and duck; however, they still sell noodles but with a slight emphasis. The interior of their place is no-frills and I think it was designed that way intentionally and that's the way I like it. The husband is missing some teeth by now, but he still smiling to every customer that pulls up affront of his counter.  Be aware that their meat cuts are on the fattier side; however, it's still just as delicious. Pick your meat and they'll get to work and fill up your container with generous portions of meat, vegetables and rice for less than $5. Where can you beat that price in NYC? Their meat's fat to lean ratio is inconsistent and it can vary depending on which batch of meat was cooked during that given time. Also, there are no seats, but there is a park across the street with plenty of benches to sit. This is a place where locals go and a mecca for anybody visiting NYC to try a taste of Chinatown.
5 WOW , don't expect great service here, but the line moves quick as you just order to go.  The prices you simply can't beat...for 3-4 bucks you get a deliciously made roast pork, bbq or chicken rice plate. If you love Chinese must try, their roast pork....crispy skin and juicy meat , very well seasoned as well.
5 Great dive spot for roast meat other rice or noodles.  Their roast pork and roast pig are from different cuts but just as good and flavorful.  A father and son operation that's awesome.
4 Quick and delicious!! Came on a Saturday afternoon. The line was out the door, but didn't take too long. CASH only. No seating here tho. Got a small roasted duck and a small roasted pig to share with one other person. It was the perfect amount and very affordable (about $4 each). They come with rice and cabbage. The meats were crispy and very flavorful! Recommend coming here if you want something quick and tasty to-go.
5 Moving to NYC, I never thought I'd find such a cheap yet delicious place like Wah Fung's!   I came here yesterday and today, first time with the boy and second time by myself since I was craving some good cha shao/char siu rice (aka roasted BBQ pork). I got the cha shao/char siu rice both times and omg, it was amazing!!!! The texture of the meat was soft and juicy with a good amount of fat and the red, sweet yet crunchy texture of the roasted pork was so good. Not only that, it also comes with a heaping layer of rice and steamed veggies (usually cabbage from my experience). It really brought me back to my hometown (Taipei), which says a lot.  You honestly cannot find a better deal than this as a large serving comes at $5.50! The restaurant itself is a hole-in-a-wall and doesn't appear to be much as it's a grab and go place (aka no sit downs) but the price and quality of the food make it all the more worth it. Definitely a must go!!  (Also note: it's cash only!)
5 I try to come here at least once every time I'm in town. The pork is juicy and unctuous. The portions are generous. And the price is unbeatable. I load up so I have extra for a couple days. Extra sauce on the rice please!
5 Cheap and delicious charsiu ! I was skeptical at first and thought this was just another overhyped joint in nyc but nah it lives up to its reputation. I'm looking forward to coming back and doing a combo w duck and pig!
5 You can't get better value for the food here...unfortunately the duck was WAY too sweet and I didn't have any. I don't think they do plain duck, chicken, or pork, its all soaked in sugar and soy.
5 This was AMAZING! Honestly, this place is the definition of no frills NY majesty. You get in a line in front of this tiny store front and order some variation of pork, duck, and rice at slightly difference price points. The Pork over small rice is $4. I repeat, a very filling and satisfying meal for $4.  I love the pork here. Most cheap chinese joints in NYC will give you the unnaturally red colored pork (which I also enjoy...), but here you get freshly roasted pork, covered in a light oil and bbq sauce. It is served with a little cabbage, and you're on your way to find a stoop or bench to gobble this down in. The fattiness of the pork really makes it, and it taste like heaven and butter.  Treat yo self.
5 An A health rating in Chinatown for these places is rare, and they have it.  Ok, onto the food.  They make tasty roast everythings (pork, duck, and chicken), and my go to us almost always the pork.  They prices they have are more than reasonable, and if they started charging more, I don't think they would lose any business.  They almost always have a line, and it's worth it!
4 Stopped in for a quick meal with a friend passing through. The line is always out the door but the food comes out quick and hot. We both got the char siu on rice with veggies for a tidy sum of 7 a person. Thankfully there was a good portion of meat and it tasted great. Hot and fresh, savory, a little sweet, and a quick hit of salt made for a great and quick meal. Four stars for a good meal that was super easy on the wallet. Why not five? I just have to come back again to try the chicken and duck before I upgrade, haha. See you soon Wah Fung!
4 Probably some of the best roast pork you can get for the price. This place provides a generous serving of delicious pork for less than $5. I come here regularly when I'm in the area and will sometimes make a trip out from Queens for it if I'm really craving it. There's plenty of Chinese BBQ places near me but I'm more than happy to make the trip out. I've yet to come early enough to get noodles instead of rice but I believe that speaks volumes about the store. Everything is being sold almost immediately after it's done, so food is always fresh and hot. I've tried the other meats and they're good but their standout is the roast pork.
3 This place has a line out the door and it's probably because the food is cheap, and the servings are generous.  I got the combo plate with chicken, duck, and bbq pork.  Both the chicken and duck were on the dry side.  The BBQ pork was flavorful and had good meat to fat ratio (which helped it from getting dry).    There's nowhere to eat here either, so eat on the street or take it to the park across the street.  It's also cash only.
4 When the precious calls to you, the precious wants you to come...the precious meats with rice! This spot is easy to pass by with out noticing other than the line that will form around lunch time! The line does move quick, it is "fast food" after all, but the kind of fast food I can get behind!  This spot has zero seating so its a grab and go place. A small plate with the pork or duck is my go to, plenty of food for a "light" lunch. A large plate will easily fill up two people.   If you dont live or work in the area, I would only come when its good weather so you can sit in the park across the street since there is no seating.
5 Ambiance Wah Fung No 1 Fast Food is a place to buy, take out, and eat it at the park across the street.  It's quick and easy to grab and go.  Bare bones Chinese take out store.  Do not expect to eat inside as there is no seating.        Food We initially got the roast pork and roast duck.  The roast pork is the BBQ char siu, not the roast pig.  We decided to go back and get the roast pig as well.  The roast pig is by far the best.  The duck is ok.  I've had better in Hong Kong.  I think the cha siu is very good as well.  It's super cheap Chinese food which they pack a lot of rice to fill the box up.    Service The customer service says it in the name, "Fast Food".  They give you the food and you are off.  It's simple and easy.  The service is good for my standards.
3 it's cheap & it is nothing special. I used fatty pork at $5. maybe lean or 50/50 is better. ? idk
5 This place sells the best take out ever. As an Asian myself I've tried countless Chinese restaurants but this I would say is one of the top! They aren't cheap with their portions like other places and their vegetables actually taste really good. In other places they would be bland or very dry but their food is delicious. I usually order the pork and they always give the perfect or maybe even more portions of meat for the amount of rice. The pricing on this place isn't bad either, in my opinion I would say it's very cheap.
3 Good for it's price but the meat was just okay. The skin of the duck was soooo fatty! The char siu was good too but I think the cabbage was the best part of it for me lol. Skip!!!
5 This place is a little ways walk from the bustle of Canal FYI.   I had seen a picture of a heaping serving of roast pork on rice on a foodie page that I follow on IG and knew I had to stop by next time I was in the city. When I arrived, the line was out of the door! It's a very small spot-- to go orders only-- so it went very quickly. I waited about 10 mins for my two orders of roast pork on rice. Get this-- $8 TOTAL (aka $4 a pop)!   *cue the confetti*!   Like I said, they are not skimpy on the meat portion at all. It's also served with steamed vegetable which I believe was cabbage. I recommend eating this immediately! They spoon sauces over the top but they will completely soaked up by the rice if you don't eat it stat.   So....   don't be deterred by the line. You know they say the longer the line, the better the food.   DO order more than one. It's so cheap, why not?
5 $4 for bbq pork over rice ?  I'm in.   This place has been on my list for sometime and I was able to knock it off the other day .   Got there after 6 and there was about 10 people on line .  Ordering was simple and after getting my food walked across the street to eat .   Not much to say besides it's delicious.
5 There's really nothing to complain about here. The line moves super quickly and the food is extremely cheap, greasy and delicious (got the chicken with lo mein type noodles). I got the small size but could still barely finish. I also tried the chicken over rice, which I would probably get next time instead of the noodles since it soaks up some of the grease (noodles themselves are also pretty greasy.. no complaints though haha). The duck over rice also looks really good, but I'm a lazy eater sometimes and didn't feel like dealing with the bones.  Like many Chinatown places, the place is cash only and you'll need to take the food out but there is a park nearby to sit at and eat. Would honestly suggest sticking with the small and seeing how much you can eat because I'd probably explode after a large.
5 Decent food for affordable prices especially if you're on a $4-5 budget! Rice, Noodles, Veggies, Chicken, Roasted Pork, and Duck. Definitely come here if you haven't been here yet. I guarantee you, this is INDEED a gem in Chinatown. The guys serving you are nice.
5 Best Cantonese BBQ in Chinatown!  The food here is about as authentic as it can be.  The restaurant has no sitting area, but the park right across the street is a perfect place to enjoy your meal!  It's price is extremely cheap for the amount of food you get, it is easily possible to fill yourself up with about 5 dollars.  Keep in mind there is always a line for the place.
5 Best for the value. The chefs here always give a generous amount of meat in addition to rice and veggies. They drench it in the soy sauce cooked in the roast pork. Yummmm! Would definitely recommend.
4 Not no 1 but still one of my favorite cheap eats in Chinatown and I especially love their cha siu (roasted bbq pork). I've tried their other proteins (chicken, duck, roast pig) and it just doesn't compare to the flavorful and tender cha siu they offer. Prices have increased over the years but you'll still get a bang for your buck here - CASH ONLY. For $4+, you're able to get a small box of rice, cabbage, and a protein (they say small but it's packed to the rim so it's usually enough for a comfortable meal). A couple dollars more and you can get a large box with the option to pick multiple proteins. Don't forget to ask for the soy sauce (packed with all the juices and fats from the meats so you already know it's going to be extra tasty) and ginger scallion sauce!!  They also have a small noodle cart set up in the back which I used to love getting the fish ball and rice noodle rolls from. Haven't gotten it in a while but I believe that this is a separate line so if noodles are all you want, you can just walk inside for that.   Quick service - you wait on line, tell them your order and the guys will chop away. It's a tiny store with no seating so you may want to bring your food and eat at the park across the street while it's still fresh. Lots of people do this so it's just a part of the wah fung experience!
5 This place is about as no frills and simple as you can get but the food is absolutely delicious. Wait on the line (which can be out the door at times)....Order all three meats...you will thank yourself later.
2 Another version of Vanessa's Dumplings, only no dumplings. Only chicken or pork. Dirty and greasy.  I saw numerous positive reviews so I decided to check it out. Sunday around 4pm only 3 people in the line. You can watch the cook to cut the pieces of meat for you. When I was watching my food being chopped and then put in the container, I was hungry and excited. Then everything changed as soon as I took my first bite. Meat has white bones in it which I found absolutely disgusting. Also, meat has weird layers and I don't want to know what that was. I paid $4 for a small tray with vegetables and white rice. Vegetables were almost non-existent in my platter. White rice was good. Skip this place if you want something decent.
4 Only reason why I'm giving it four stars is because I thought there would be more meat. But then I saw the price of $6 and I was like holy crap, what a deal!  The bbq pork is so tender and full of flavor, and with the duck, you can sorta feel the fat melt in your mouth. (Don't worry, it's not too much). Perhaps the best was when they poured some of the fat, or I mean sauce over the meat and rice. You could taste it before you ate it~~~
5 Small, dirty, greasy, fatty, cheap, delicious, amazing. These are just a few of the words that describe Wah Fung.  $7 will be plenty to get you a massive meal here. For the price, you're getting unmatched quality and deliciousness. This is definitely not the type of food you want to be eating everyday, but trust me if I could I would...
5 The line for this place is always long, but the price is worth it. Might be the best deal regarding Cantonese BBQ dishes in Chinatown. They tend to run out of noodles near the end of the day, but it's okay since I've never seen them run out of rice. The portions are very generous too. A $5 meal here can feed me for days.
5 This place is amazing, and cheap!   The roast pork and duck were cooked perfectly and came with cabbage and rice.  It's a really small take out joint, so no seats inside.  You will likely have to wait in line for at least 15 minutes but its well worth it.
5 I felt like I was back in China. Cash Only. Minimal choices. Fast service.  I got a large box with Roasted Duck, Roasted BBQ Pork, Rice and Cabbage. The quality was amazing and super filling.  I arrived just in time before the long lunch line arrived. It is literally a hole in the wall joint. You walk up and let the guy know what size, meats, rice or noodle.  The only thing that is missing from this place is the traditional sauces that usually accompany these chinese delicacies. But all-in-all, this is a must go-to place when visiting NY.
5 Food: Best Char Siu Pork Rice in Manhattan. Super tender meat and the juices are a perfect blend of sweet and savory. The juices and fat drip into the rice and make for a great memorable meal.  Atmosphere: you can find wahfung in a tiny spot on Chrystie st. You'll usually find a line but the wait won't be too long. It's pretty cramped inside but for the food you get it honestly doesn't matter. There are no seats so you'll either have to get it to go back somewhere or eat at the park nearby.  Price: One of the best bang for your buck meals in all of New York. The small is enough for a hearty meal and only $4.   Overall: If you are in Manhattan Chinatown this is a must try. It can be a full lunch or you can share with people and it can be a go to snack. The price can't be beat and I would say it is the best char siu pork that I have tried.
5 There was a line at the door but they were very quick and it was easy to order! We ordered pork and duck, it was plenty!
5 This is Chinatown at its finest! Great food at Super affordable price. Roast duck is a must try. I wish I work closer to here so I can come for a cheap yet satisfying lunch everyday! Everything here is good, meat is always tender, flavorful and juicy. It's pretty much a hole in a wall, but I love it - it's like the spirit of Chinatown, no frills but constantly delivers on the essence of what you looking for.
4 Just enjoyed a quick, cheap and fast meal.  A large order of roast pork and duck.  It comes over white rice (no brown rice) with cabbage for 6 bucks. I enjoyed the hell out of it!  Filling and the pork is great, the duck was also good.  No probs here
1 The cha Xiao meat was spoiled! Don't buy it when it is hot.  You don't know how they made it.
5 This place has probably one of the best value to taste/portion ratios on the planet. The food here is very cheap, $4-5 dollars can simply get you a rice meal with some BBQ pork. The food is extremely good and they have this amazing sauce that they put on all their meats. Lines may be longer than average, but not extremely long. Basically, the wait is worth the food. Not to mention, the place is located near a park which is one of the best places to eat after you order from there. All in all, very good value and very good taste.
5 We visited this store for 4 consecutive days! LOL It is cheap , super affordable yet tasty.  We tried the crispy roast pork with noodles and also the bbq pork with rice. They are good!! The sauce also add some flavors and the crackling! oh my... the crisp, fatty skin of the roast pork. Nyam!  There is no seating inside, it's pay and go. You can enjoy them at the benches across the street.   My husband said the samwoo in LA has better roast pork but oh well maybe this is NY style samwoo
4 Was Fun Number 1 has some of the best fast-food Chinese food in Chinatown.  The portions are really large and the food is very fresh.  Even the meat dishes are very generous in portion size.  For $8, you can eat like a king.  Service is what you expect in Chinatown. Fast and not overly friendly.    I just wish they didn't use styrofoam!
5 5 STARS omg. The price for the food you're getting is unbeatable it's crazy. Roast duck/roast pork/BBQ pork?? I got a large size with roast pork and BBQ pork for around $6. It was so filling I couldn't move afterwards. Next time I come here I'm getting the small size with BBQ pork for $4. I think that'll be filling enough. The large contains so much rice. I also don't think I'll be getting the roast pork next time because they only really gave me the skin, I wanted the meat too!! No worries though because BBQ pork tasted great and I was full after eating it. Everyone who walked past me at the park in front of it, kept staring at my steamy food and a few people actually asked me where I got that because it just looked sooooll delicious. Believe me it's great and for the price you're getting it at, it's ah-mazing!!
5 A great place for cheap eat! Their portion is huge and you cannot beat their price. The food was very flavorful and pumping hot. Their set rice with pork or roasted duck are very delicious. Whenever I visit this place I would buy extra meat for the entire week. Highly recommend if you only want take-out food and is looking for some high quality cheap eats.
5 Wah Fung is great! Mind you I found out about this place through the $5 guy on YouTube because I love cheap eats in New York City my husband tour this food up when we first went here! They have the $6 for Meats where you can choose any meats you want either for porks for chickens or two porks or two chicken.. it's a dollar more if you want the noodles instead of the rice. What's the $4 one it's $0.50 more with the noodles. Doesn't matter because their food is awesome!
5 I'm usually wary of places that have "No. 1" in their names, but in this case, it may actually be true!  It's rare to see a place maintain quality when offering such large portions for such great prices, i.e. a large styrofoam platter of 2 BBQ meats, rice, and cabbage that feeds 2 people for $6.   It's not "fancy restaurant" quality, but the meats are very flavorful and tender, the rice was fluffy and warm, and the cabbage added some nice texture to each bite.   The duck is very good and comes with crispy skin. They slice it for you, but be ready to wrestle with some bones. Next time I would probably just get the roasted BBQ pork because it is (delicious first of all, but also) boneless and much easier to eat with a plastic fork in the park nearby.   Service was friendly and the line went through pretty quickly. It's take out and cash only, but such a great option for tasty/quick/cheap food in the neighborhood.
5 This is the place you need to go to if you like good meat and don't want to spend more than $10.  You get a damned filling, hot meal, which tastes GREAT, for $8 maximum.  I got a huge portion of roasted pork and another of duck, with rice and another side, and spent $14.    Again, it's the quality that drives me wild.  Definitely, definitely, definitely worth it, especially considering how stupidly expensive good food can be in NYC.
5 Very affordable and very good Cantonese meats! Their $4 cha siu rice plate makes for a great meal to go, won't break the bank and is bursting with flavor. For a little extra, you can add roast duck or size up to a large!
5 Highly recommend their roast pork over rice w/ lettuce. It is very affordable, abundant, and super delicious! There is always a long line but it is worth the wait!   This place is take out only, but it is across the park so you can find a clean bench to sit, people watch while eating your delicious meal!
5 Great lunch deal with $5 for a great small plate of pork & rice. Also the cabbage was a great cleanser to the strong pork! But overall would totally recommend!!
5 Great quick bite. Awesome pricing. Food isn't overly sweet nor salty. Highly recommend it!
5 Simple yet delicious. To the point. Literally everything is great. The pork is perfectly cooked, the chicken is Bomb AF, and the duck is also pretty damn Delicious. I hate to admit that I'm obsessed with this crispy ass skin, it's kind of like a potato chip. I think it's the sweet Savory  crunchiness that kills me softly. The sauce that the meat comes dripping in turns that white rice into something like crack cocaine if I ever tried it. The cabbage is a perfect palate cleanser, to make you feel like you're eating healthy and stuff after shoving down mouthfuls of pork and rice. There's pretty much always a line but it moves super fast. don't expect top notch customer service, just get your food pay and go and eat the deliciousness. There's only like 3 menu items. In the words of my native New Yorker father, K.I.S.S ..keep it simple stupid
5 It's $4 for rice vegetables and amazing honey roasted pork aka char siu. There's no where to sit and this is pretty much a take out place and there's most definitely ALWAYS a line but with reason. You can get an entire meal for $4! I love how they have been sticking true to their business and have been serving the local community for years. This place makes amazing char siu. I usually just eat it at the park across the street or take it to go. The line moves pretty fast so don't worry, and if you don't eat pork there is duck as well! I'm sure it's extremely taste as well.
5 Cheap and delicious. Great food!!  Went here with friends. It was hard for me to know what to order/ how ordering worked because it was my first time. Regulars come in and out fairly quickly with their food, and it's a very small tight space, so I felt bad standing in the way, looking at the menu and trying to figure out how to order haha. But it's all good yo. Service is really fast.   I got one protein, duck, with rice. It comes with some steamed veggies. The amount of meat is super generous and is SUPERRRR juicy and they spoon some other juice on it so it's super super moist. My meal was $4 so it is very very worth.   I highly recommend!!! I tried some of my friends other proteins like pork and chicken and it is also very moist and delicious. Only con is that it's to go, but we just sat and ate at the Popeyes down the block haha.
4 Heard through friends that Wah Fung was a must try! My boyfriend waited in line to get us the roasted pig and roasted pork, which comes with napa and rice. The line moved quickly and we got our food within minutes of standing in the line. The meat had mostly fat on them, so I only took a few bites and ate more of the rice and napa. My boyfriend, who loves to eat meat fat enjoyed it more than I did. I've definitely had better roasted pig and roasted pork with more flavorful lean meat. However, you can't beat the price of $6 for that amount of food. I'm from Boston, so it usually costs us at least $10-12.
5 Pretty much what I expected thanks to the other reviews. You more than likely walk up to a line out the door but it moves pretty quickly.  They were really quick with taking my order and bonus points for making it right in front of you.   I got the roasted pork and chicken all for a cool $8!  I preferred the roasted chicken. It was softer if that makes sense. However the chicken did have bones whereas the pork did not.  Definitely going back for the chicken.
5 Loved it! Best $4 ever spent. Went on a Sunday afternoon and only waited 10min! Comes in larger size for $5.50 too
5 I've been a big fan of wag fung's small char siu over rice for the longest time ever since i heard about them. Their small char siu over rice is under $5 which is a steal because its one of NYC's cheapest char siu over rice. This is one of NYC's best cheap eats in NYC. They are truly the champions of char siu.
5 Went here on a late night looking for some cheap eats after I heard what a little treasure  this place was. It's a super small spot just big enough for a line of about 4 people at a time to enter and place your order, had the duck and pork and I have to say the duck was disappointing as it was a bit cold and with an odd flavor but the PORK was the star of the show. You can get a flavorful and filling lunch for like 5 dollars, the pork over rice was crispy and caramelized and dare I say... JUICY. Would def Come back for another bite :D
5 When I think of the best savory NYC comfort food, Wah Fung is one of the first spots to come to mind. It's one of the rare gems in the city where your dollar will get you very far.  You'll see a line on the sidewalk on Chrystie Street by Chinatown, across from the Sara D. Roosevelt Park. Don't worry; it moves fast.  For $4.50 (CA$H), you can get a "small" box of meat over rice. The small is actually plenty of food for a satisfying meal or big snack. Only get the large for $6 if you're ravenous and want a full meal. But I usually don't do this because when in Chinatown I like to go dumpling and bakery hopping at a bunch of different places.  All the meats (pork, duck, chicken) are good, but what you need to get is the roast pork and then the duck. The roast pork is crisp on the outside, tender on the inside, a bit smoky, and very subtly sweet. The duck is fantastic, but bear in mind that you'll have bones to deal with. The way they roast the meat creates a delicious, natural caramellization that makes it so addicting. You can safely skip the chicken. Not because it's bad (it's tasty as hell), but because you can find good roast chicken anywhere else. But the roast pork? It's Wah(n) of a kind (sorry, I had to).  If you need a super cheap yet incredibly satisfying meal in Chinatown, Wah Fung will definitely satisfy your meat and rice cravings. Honestly, I would prefer to eat my box of Wah Fung on a park bench to dining at most a sit-down restaurants.
3 This was a very small store and pretty easy to miss. Make sure you don't walk right past it like I did. LOL! Be on the look out for the big red roof. The store can only fit so many people, maybe 3 people in line, but the line usually stretches outside.  I got a size small with roast pig and roast pork. One was crispy and crunchy. One was slightly sweet. I don't really know which was which, but I do recommend getting the half and half because the crunchy and sweetness go very well together. I loved how they pour the sauce over the rice right before they close the lid. It gave it a little more flavor. Honestly, I didn't think this was worth going to. It was cheap and it was filling though.  You can't eat in the store though. You have to take it to go. There is a park across the street with a few tables you can eat at.
5 This place has really great food! Very affordable and delicious at the same time! Recommanded for a fast and easy meal.
5 The rice is so flavorful as they really take the time to pour the sauce over BBQ. Their roasted pork is so famous and I found at least 4 ppl are eating the same food with me in the park opposite the restaurant. I went there around 230 and there is still a line of 4 or 5 ppl ahead of me. The service is on the slow side I have to say. The crispy pork is my favorite and I find the duck mediocre.
5 This may be the single best value for food in the city. The large roast pork/duck combo comes with enough meat for two meals. I like that they even put in a bit of veggies so I didn't feel like a total pig. I try to come during odd hours so I can skip the line. Here's to hoping the place never changes!
5 10/10 place for a quick and delicious lunch/dinner/snack. There's two sizes - $4.50 for a small aluminum container and $6.00 for a large styrofoam box. This is not a sit-in restaurant. Stopped by at 5pm on a Sunday and there was a line of about 3 people but the guys in there move fast.   I got half chicken, half roast pork and it comes with cabbage. For only $6, they are not skimp on the portions! The pork was crispy on the outside, tender and well seasoned! Not too salty and the perfect amount of fat:meat ratio. The chicken was so good! So moist and had plenty of meat. I really like how they make sure to put sauce on your rice, too. You literally cannot beat the price, flavor, portions, and convenience of this place.   You can always eat right outside at the park across the street for an authentic Chinatown NY experience! My bf and I ate half while standing in the front waiting for our Uber haha, doesn't get any better than that! :P
5 My go-to spot whenever I'm in Chinatown. Easily. For $4 you can get rice, cabbage and pork / chicken. It's really a great deal if you want a meal and you're in a pinch downtown.
4 The roast pork is worth the wait.  It is sweet, savory, and salty.  It would hit every part of your pallet!
4 I've been eating their roast pork for 3+ years now. It is absolutely delicious and cheap. The only reason why I am docking a star is because they raised the price on their small plate while decreasing the amount of pork they pile on. They used to pile that sucker on to the point where a small could really be eaten as two small meals. Now it's just a normal one :( lol but I can't complain about a 4 dollar stunner like this one.
4 One of my many go to roast places for simple dishes. Only take out, very reasonably priced and darn good roast meats, chicken, duck, pig and pork. You can get it with rice and cabbage or just meat. Always a line and a bare bones setup that screams out authentic food.
4 Walking through Chinatown this place stood out to me because of the huge line that forms. We were walking toward the subway as the snow storm came down and surprisingly this place still had a line. The food is super cheap! Everytime I come here I have to get the roast pork and lo mein noodles. I love the noodles because they're the fatter type of noodles and the roast pork. The small box for one meat and one side is 4.99 and the bigger box is 6.99. Even after waiting an hour to get back to our hotel the roast pork was still so moist and the flavors were still there. If you work near Chinatown and is ale to go here for lunch i'm super jealous of you right now..
3 This place is so cheap for so much food, but I think I was just put off by the cleanliness of the place. I ordered the regular sized dish with duck and pork on top. The food just tasted okay to me--I think it was definitely quantity over quality. Maybe I'm just not used to the flavors/type of meat.   The interior was kind of gross to be honest and although the guy was using gloves/different hands to touch the food/cash, it just seemed kind of dirty and unsanitary to me. Think this distorted my view on the food. I would definitely say to check it out, because it's dirt cheap. The only thing you're wasting if anything is your time, as there's always a line out the door.
5 5/5 quality and value. If I ever get to Chinatown I'll get two large orders, one for now and one for later. If you love chinese BBQ then this place ensures that you'll be satisfied in terms of taste and fullness. The long lines tell it all; get the roast duck or bbq pork, you won't be disappointed.
5 Wah Fung No 1 has been a staple since childhood to get roast pork over rice. You will continuously see long lines for this place, because it's that good and affordable. Starting at $4.50 (small), you really can't beat the price for the amount of meat they give you. They also offer duck, chicken and other pieces of meat here. Though the food is good, I do have to warn you that each time I eat from here, I do have to use the bathroom after (not diarrhea). However, this doesn't stop me from coming if I'm craving for roast pork.  *cash only*- don't you dare show up with a credit card! It's chinatown afterall! ;)
5 I think of this place as the Chinese Chik-fil-A. But instead of delicious greasy fried chicken with waffle fries and sauce, you get delicious greasy roasted meat with rice, cabbage, and more grease. There's a reason for that long line out the door, even in the rain. It's because Wah Fung is unbelievably inexpensive and the food is absolutely delicious. I highly suggest getting two meats (the roast pork and duck), which is only $6. Crazy how prices be like dat.   Wah Fung No. 1 on the street, No. 1 in my heart.
5 Delicious pork and duck for a great price. The small serving is big enough for one meal.
5 My go to place for roast pork for like the last ten years of my life. I remember they used to have this place that deep fried veggies in the back, loved that but apparently they had to get rid of it cause no one was ordering it, sigh.  Anyway, there will be haters who call this place unsanitary and expensive because they raised their price like a quarter over the last two years. Listen, I've had my fair share of roast pork and this is as good as it gets. It hurts me when I bring people here and they say some wild things like "nah, this place in upper west side is better." I'll be eating at this bougie Chinese fusion places like buddhakan or the like, and this will cost like six times more and be like 1/10th as good.   I know it can't be healthy cause that sauce is like crazy addictive, and it is sometimes unappetizing cause it's basically fat and sugar ladled it but MAN IS IT SO GOOD. It's Chinatown so it's not gonna be the cleanest thing, but I don't even care, my body has built up resistance to any germs I can get from here.
4 Came here after watching the Fung Bros video and I have to say I'm pretty impressed! For $4 I got the roasted pork, rice and cabbage meal which is a bargain. The pork was super flavorful, tender and moist. A very good balance of sweet and savory flavors from the sauce. The cabbage was a good balance from the fatty meat. Just wish I had a little more meat because I had so much rice left over! Other than that can't beat the price, make sure you bring cash and an empty stomach
4 After seeing this spot all over YouTube and Instagram, I had to check out what all the hype is! I went here on a Saturday morning at 9:30am (the prime time for Chinese barbecue, am I right), and ordered the $6 roast pork/duck over rice plate.  I can definitely say that this meal was well-worth the price! You get a massive portion of delicious barbecued meat for super cheap. The charsiu and roast duck weren't the best that I've ever had, but the quality and taste of the food is definitely well worth the price!   I wish I lived closer to this shop! I would definitely be a regular here for the yummy, affordable food!
5 There's always a line here for good reason. (Don't worry it goes super fast, it's a takeout spot.)  This place is where I take all my friends. And where they take their families after, haha.  Their pork is the best. Char siu.  It comes with cabbage and rice. (I dislike veggies and trust me.. Even the cabbage is delicious.)  It's also super affordable.  The dudes that work here only need to hear you say "smol pork, please", it's not overwhelming.  (The smol is enough for two light eaters.)  Eat across the street at the benches or take your haul home. Believe the hype, this place is legend, been going here for the longest!
5 One of the best deals in the city. A small portion (with a generous helping of meat) is less than $5. Comes with a little cabbage, but the BBQ meats are the star of the show. Chinese fast food at its best, usually a line out the door, but moves quickly as the workers are adept at getting orders out quickly, efficiently. They ladle some sauce (drippings in soy sauce) over the rice for extra flavor. Delicious despite the cheap prices. Roast pig and roast pork are my favorites, but the duck and chicken are excellent as well, but you will have to pick through bones in the latter two. For the hungry man, the large portion is $6.50. Cash Only.
5 One of the most legendary chinese bbq spots in the city. Come here, order the Char Siu rice box along with other meats, and enjoy life for under $10.
5 I was in the area getting a haircut, and I've been craving char siu since I moved to NY, so I figured I would give this place a try and see what all the hype was about!  With how popular this place is, there's usually always a line out the door, but it moved by pretty quickly when I went.  A large size char siu with cabbage over rice is dirt cheap ($5.50)!  I definitely would have been able to split this over two meals, but it was just SO damn delicious.  The char siu was the best I've had in a long time -- but to my surprise, the CABBAGE absolutely blew me away.  I have no idea what they do to the sauce to make it taste so good.  It seeps into the rice too, so you get the savoriness of the cabbage sauce in every bite.  Hypothetically, if they ran out of meat one day and all they had was the cabbage, I would still order it.    There's a nice little park across the street with a ton of benches where you can take your meal and eat it.  Around lunchtime, it seemed like every other person had something from Wah Fung.  I can definitely see myself coming back here every single time I'm in the area -- it's just too delicious and too good of a deal to pass up.  And the thing is, I still need to try the roast pork belly, roast duck, and the scallion ginger sauce that other people have been raving about.  I'm super excited!
5 CASH ONLY!   For only $4, you can get a densely packed, piping hot, delicious bowl of rice, cabbage, and a type of meat. I always get the roast pork and take it to the park across the street because this place is literally a hole in the wall. The meat is juicy and flavorful, and I love that they really pack it in on top of the rice. No matter the time, there's always a line out the door, but it moves relatively quickly. I've never had to wait more than 15 minutes.
4 There was a good size line outside which I took as a good sign. The line moved very slow, but steady. $7.50 for a large chicken over rice with a can of coke and a bottled water. Not too shabby. The only con is everything was so greasy. I expect a normal amount of grease, but this was excessive. It seems like a petty complaint I know, but just posting my experience. For the price and portion size, I really can't complain.
5 Simply the best. The rice box is cheap and delicious. All the hype you hear is real. The sauce that they smother the rice in is incredible. It's nice because they're not shy about the quantity of meat or sauce.   The line looks long but it moves relatively quickly. Don't be intimated as this $4 meal is worth the wait.   I've had the char siu and the chicken. Both are superb in terms of flavor, tenderness, and savory. I would not hesitate to recommend anyone to come get this. For $4 you can be very full and happy.   A+
5 Authentic, cheap, and delicious. What more could you want?! The line is always long (and unfortunately slow) but the men inside are always working hard to serve everyone. I make sure to leave them a tip because of it. You can't beat a large heaping of white rice with cabbage and generous serving of fresh Chinese style meat. The best part is when they pour extra juice. Get the large, it's worth paying a little extra for bc you get so much more. My Taiwanese mom says this place the best & authentic. Of course, be careful of the bones if you're unaware but that's how it's always served. My favorites are definitely the bbq pork (cha siu) and roast duck
5 Ugh, this is one of those places I regret not going to earlier, especially since I have one friend who keeps saying, "You should try this place" every time we walk past it.  Pretty sure my mom would complain that $6.50 is way too much for char siu pork, chicken, and duck over like a faceful of rice because Chinese Mom.   The large three meat box is just enough for two XS adults. Duck is obvsly the best and char siu pork is obvsly #2, and I don't care about the chicken but would eat it if someone else bought it for me.  And, and, they call every Chinese woman/girl under 45 靚女 (!!!).
5 Wah Fung is a long-standing hole-in-the-wall bbq place in Chinatown that will make both your stomach and wallet VERY VERY happy. It's so cheap and so delicious - I usually get the half roast pork and half duck over rice and cabbage for $6. If you just want the bbq roast pork over rice, I think it's around $4. The roast pork is crispy, fatty, juicy and authentic while the duck is tender with a good fat-meat ratio. This place is incredibly generous with their portions. They also add extra sauce on everything in the end so the rice, cabbage, and bbq taste flavorful! I usually avoid eating the rice at Chinese places but the rice soaked in meat sauces smelled and tasted too good to avoid. Me: 0, Carbs: 1   Be prepared to wait in line ALWAYS. I've never seen this place without a line. The place has no seats and consists of one counter where the guys butcher the meat. You'll receive your meal in a styrofoam container and a plastic bag and walk out. I would grab some tea at Kung Fu's next door and eat at the park across the street (where there are public tables).   Anyone who visits Chinatown should try this place. It's the epitome of what Manhattan's Chinatown use to be like before all the gentrification hit (I'm still bitter about the fact that there's a Subway sandwiches on Canal...)   CASH ONLY and closed on Monday.
4 One of the good char siu places in Chinatown.  For four bucks, you could get a filling packed box filled with lots of rice, your one choice of siu mei (Cantonese roasted meats) and some boiled napa cabbage.  For 50 cents more, you could get a combination of two meats in the same container.  The quality of the char siu was great, with tender meat and a very good fat-meat ratio while being crispy in some spots.  Part of the reason is that it gets soaked up in the juices compared to other places.  You cannot really screw up some boiled napa cabbage, but it was good.  But for the rice, it was kinda mushy and needed less water to enjoy the rice flavored with pork juice.  This is a take out place; no seating within establishment but you just could eat it in the park.  Be sure if you don't speak any Chinese, be sure to bring somebody who understands it.  Cheap, filling char siu fan (barbecued pork {over} rice) in Chinatown.
5 $4 for a huge serving of tasty roast pork and rice? I would be here on the daily if I was a New Yorker. There was a short line out the door, which is apparently always the case, but the guys behind the counter are fast. Cash only. I suggest grabbing your drink from the tea place on the corner and finding a bench in the park across the street to bunker down and feast.
5 Omg. I still have dreams about this place. Their dumplings are literally the best thing I have ever tasted! The community seating is a bit weird, and there was no public restroom (unless we just didn't look hard enough). Despite all of that, this place deserves 5 stars! We recommend it to anyone who tells us they are visiting NYC, and we can't wait to go back ourselves. I might just hop on a 5 hour flight just for this...
5 Great find! Food was really good, really fast, really fresh. The wait might be long during the normal meal times. We (party of 4)went on a Saturday at 3 and waited 40 minutes. It's family style seating so fun to meet other people from other places. They are know for their soup dumplings. Delicious!!! Also ordered scallion pancake and sesame chicken. Yum! Cash only but there's an atm right at the entrance. Visiting from California and wish we had this in our town.
5 We ordered Joe's Shanghai to our hotel while staying in Manhattan on business. We got a large variety of items and all of them were very good. I highly recommend Joe's of you get a craving for some excellent Chinese delivery.
3 For second dinner we decided on Joe's Shanghai! They are known for their soup dumplings and we couldn't wait to try them :) We ordered some beers, tea and crab/pork soup dumplings. We also got some scallion pancakes as well.  The soup dumplings were good but weren't the best I've had. The broth tasted great and you get plenty of crab but the meat itself I feel wasn't seasoned as well. The scallion pancakes were okay too. Overall the meal was just okay. Worth the try though!
4 In the heart of China town, such a cute area. But it gets extremely busy and just be warned you might have to share a table with people you don't know. The food is wonderful! My family and I had the ?vegetable fried rice, the vegetable lo mein, and the fried noodles with beef. All super yummy! My personal favorite was the vegetable fried rice. Prices are very reasonable. Would definitely go back if I was in the area again. Such a cool place! Just wish it was a little bigger.
4 I'll admit, I was skeptical about this place due to fear of it being overhyped. However, it looks like this place deserves the stars it has!  We came at around 8:40 pm on a Thursday night, was told we would wait at least 25 minutes, which was more or less accurate.  As per Yelp reviews, I decided to go with the scallion pancake, pork xiao long bao, shanghai noodle soup, and the general tso chicken. ALL WERE DELICIOUS. My favorites were the XLB and the noodles. The only thing I would say is that the scallion pancakes were way too oily, and the chicken got overwhelming, and it was also $18- wtf? My mom's first bite of the food was "it's good," which is really rare of her to say. Anyways, yeah, that's my take, order what I said and you'll be fine.
5 After seeing 5K+ Yelp reviews, how could we resist? On a family vacation to NYC, we were in Chinatown and hungry and our favorite app led us to Joe's Shanghai. There was a 15 minute wait but they have chairs outside. Seating is communal so expect to make new friends.   The food was simply outstanding! Pork and crab dumplings were bursting with flavor and perfectly cooked. Even something as mundane as fried rice or sautéed noodles was elevated to a new level of taste.   Payment is cash only and there's a 15 percent tip already added. Portions are huge and enough to be shared between two people. Service was good although I'd have loved some more recommendations from the wait staff.  Warning: Dumplings are super hot and soupy inside, don't scoop them straight into your mouth! I found out the hard way!
5 The BEST dumplings in NYC.   No reservations, walk in and cash only. Also they might sit you at a table with parties.
3 Excited to try this place especially because of the good reviews. This place was packed on late Monday afternoon. Waited about 10-15 minutes. Community style seating. You can be sat with strangers at a round table if you have a small party OR lucky enough to get private seating. People are friendly and keep to themselves. Saw others making friends and even sharing lol. The restaurant itself was pretty small, saw a large queue start to form after we finished eating. Over heard a party of 4-5 be quotes for a 40 minute wait. came for the xao long bao, left on the disappointed.  Being a fan of din tai fung I had very had high expectations. XLB wrappers were very thick and broke easily. On the better note, good taste and the actual XLB was on the larger size. On the cheaper side so wasn't too disappointed. Tried the pan fried noodles and scallion pancake and those made the visit worth it.   PRO TIP: CASH ONLY, ATM outside. I get paranoid about random ATMS so I ran down the block to Bank of America and withdrew money from there.
4 Great soup dumplings!  We made mistake to order other items off their menu.  We should have only order their amazing soup dumplings because we felt everything else was just okay in comparison.
4 The food was great. Busy place! So you should be patient waiting to be seated. Love the pork soup dumplings. The fried rice as well was delicious!
4 Joe's is definitely one of my favorite places to get xiao long bao. The soup dumplings have a rich broth and aren't too heavy. Other must try's are the scallion pancake and fried pork dumplings. Both are good compliments to soup dumplings and have a nice consistency (very doughy)!   This place is definitely a tourist trap which makes waiting times very long (usually 30/45 mins+) so I definitely recommend getting there early. They really try to get everyone in and out as fast as possible, so there's very little accommodation to your party which makes the service kinda iffy. But it's whatever, the food makes it totally worth.   Overall; Joe's is definitely a must-stop for soup dumpling enthusiasts!!
5 Joe's hole in a wall. Shanghai noodle is must to try. Green string beans was made excellent. Kung pao chicken is ok if you don't mind it's super spicy. I didn't ask to make it without chilly overload. If you love peanuts it's a lot in king pao. Expect to have 2-3 guests on your large round table and have conversation together. Restroom need to be repaired. Nobody expected clean restaurant from Chinese fellas. At least believe they wash hands after dirty stuff and removes stickers from complementary oranges before cutting. Good luck
4 The food was incredible here! While service isn't the friendliest, they definitely have a system in place to get you seated, fed and out the door quickly to accommodate as many customers as they can in their small dining area. We didn't have one set server the whole time but somehow the orders came out perfectly each time. I liked how they asked me as soon as we were seated if we wanted to order any soup dumplings since they are well known for that and it takes a little while to prepare. We ordered both types of soup dumplings, scallion pancakes, Shanghai style noodles and crispy noodles. Everything was amazing! I wasn't a huge fan of the crispy noodles but others in our group liked it. They deep fried noodles to make it crispy and then ladle a thick sauce all over it with lots of veggies and shrimp. Would definitely go back for the dumplings!
5 Authenticate Shanghainese dumplings. Have been looking for such places for a long time, finally I found it. Great! Will come back for sure.
1 Friends and I waited for almost an hour to get a table, even though the girl told us 20 mins wait. We went from 2 people ahead of us to 4 because she let 2 Asian group in and not have them wait just like everyone else. We finally sat, please know, all dumplings are pork. The food was just like any other Fast food Chinese restaurant, nothing special. Not worth the wait and the hype.
1 Service was typical and the food came out extremely fast.   Pork soup dumplings were rancid and sour I almost threw up. These were the worst soup dumpling I've ever had.   Scallion pancake was decent and super crispy but they fry it in very old oil.   Crispy noodles were good. Large portions and good flavor.  Joes is a decent place for fast American style Chinese food, but I would recommend going somewhere else for soup dumplings. Maybe my dumplings were old but there was definitely something very off by them.
4 Really great food service is really good a little expensive but worth it!Everything looks great inside.My kids loved it
4 This place is famous for their soup dumplings, but I would say they are pretty average. I don't really eat soup dumplings but the few times I've tried out some other restaurants, Joe's Shanghai wasn't amazing. Its good. Not amazing though. However, they are priced well and it is pretty cheap to eat here.  I also recommend getting a scallion pancake. You will not regret it. It is really good. Enough said.
5 Perhaps the best chines food I have ever eaten. Dumplings were incredible, scallion pancake blew my mind, and sweet and sour chicken and rice was delicious. Whenever I stop through NYC, I will be sure to make a stop here. The lines out the door speak to the quality of the food. Definitely stop here if you have the chance.
1 Don't like this place at all for several reasons. The soup dumplings aren't that good because they have a strong pork smell (smells like old pork); also the dumplings sauce is all set and not covered on the table before the customers arrive(personally think that's kinda disgusting); let alone that, their tableware aren't clean. I can see the dry crab meat on the spoon ( it must from the last customer's and they didn't wash it throughly. How gross is that?) On the other hand, the restaurant is busy all the time I suggest. They have three different customers sit on one table. I heard that is a style of this restaurant though. However, I hate that although the people on my table are nice to me but I find it strange, reason why is because they stare at the way we eat and the face my friend and I have( we make funny faces because of the place).  Well, if you have the budget, I rather to visit other restaurants where have similar menu items. I just personally hate the idea sharing table :) and dirty tableware.
5 Our number one place to go for soup dumplings. We don't usually order anything else so can't say much about the other dishes. The wait can be long at times but it's definitely worth it.  It's the perfect about of soup, pork, and skin per dumpling. We love to order the crab one. It's absolutely delicious and I'm getting hungry just thinking about it!
4 One of my favorite places for soup dumplings in NYC! There is almost always a wait and it's cash only but it is worth it. You can get a lot of food for a small amount of cash. The regular dumplings, fried rice and scallion pancakes can't be missed!
4 Good Shanghainese food BUT don't come here for the Xiaolongbao. For a place known for Xiaolongbao, theirs really disappointed me because it was so bland and overly chewy. However, the other dishes were great. The scallion pancake was my favorite because it's super crispy and flavorful, but be forewarned that it tastes nothing like the ones you can buy at the supermarket.   Make sure to come right when the restaurant opens to avoid waiting for a really long time. It's a bit on the pricier end but it's probably worth it. Overall, I would probably come here again but will try other things on the menu.
4 Their  soup dumplings  are very good. The scallion  pancake was tasty and crunchy.  I also liked  fried rice. Overall,  the quality  of the food and service  were pretty  good.
4 For sure an adventure, not the best Chinese food I have ever had but very interesting. First off cash only so make sure you know that. Second it a scrum to get into this place so for sure plan to get there 30 minutes or more before you plan to eat and don't be surprised as you get seated for 10 strangers at a big family style table.  We were at a table for 10 with just the two of us. We had the soup dumplings of course and they were for sure the highlight. If I would were to go back I would have gotten two orders of those and perhaps just one dish more (for two people).  They are worthwhile as others point out, be very careful when eating as the soup is inside.   We had a sesame chicken dish that was very good and a broc beef that wasn't amazing but servicable.  This is an experience and due to buddy who lives in the city I found it.  As point out cash only and the put the 15% tip for you, frankly the service sucks so they probably were getting less so added in.
5 Incredible!! Super long wait but it was so worth it! The dumplings were out of this world!
1 If you Asian or Asian tourist don't eat at this place,  it's not worth it. Nothing special with the pork dumpling and the fried rice. It's expensive too!. They put us sitting together with 3 other parties! The waiters kept bumping to my chair. This is like eating in a market. I rather go to Din Dai Fung same price but you eat in peace and happier!
5 Worth the wait. Only a few minutes before the super efficient staff sat us at a large table with two open seats. I love that they use every available seat and sharing tables is the best. We started with soup dumplings and scallion pancakes. Had many Tsingtao beers and the attentive staff provided very quick service. The broccoli beef had large succulent slices of beef and crispy broccoli. The Shanghainese fried rice with scallions and eggs blew my mind
5 Great food  ambiance adds to your experience as you dine in Chinatown NYC.  Pork dumplings in soup are as delicious as you would expect them to be.  Service is quick as there is always people waiting to be seated.  Cash only with an ATM appropriately found right outside the entrance.  Ordered sesame chicken which was also quite delicious and it comes with a nice side of green broccoli .  And something that I loved was that end of meal orange slices placed in the table.  Sweet delicious fresh orange slices to help cleanse your after meal taste buds.  If you are visiting NYC I would recommend taking an Uber to get there as Chinatown can be confusing if you don't know it.
4 Joe's Shanghai is a lot of fun.  It feels very "authentic" (whatever that word means these days).  I am Chinese and have had a lot of dumplings and xiao long boa in my life (including in Shanghai), so I can't say that the dumplings and XLB were the best I've ever had.  However, they were definitely yummy, and I would go back (and wait in line).  The service is quick (though not friendly, but what can you expect from a Chinese restaurant).    One thing that was off-putting was the smell when you walk in - the sour smell was confusing.  It was either the smell of feet on a hot summer day OR the smell of the red vinegar you put on the dumplings.  I chose to think it was the dumpling vinegar.
4 I went to this place due to the good reviews on Yelp.  It did not disappoint.  We tried both the pork soup dumplings and the crab pork soup dumplings, spicy Szechuan sliced beef special and the scallion pancake.  Helpful tips, CASH ONLY, 15% tip already included on check and may get a communal table and sit with other people.  Review: Beer:  They have limited beer and very limited wine selection.  We had Tsing Tao beer.  Food:  The soup dumplings were very good.  It was our first time having them and enjoyed them.  I just did not find them as exciting as some of the Yelp reviews.  We liked the pork soup better than the crab/pork soup but both were very good.   We would get them again but may not make the journey just for to get them.  We also had the spicy szechuan sliced beef.  It was indeed spicy.  I like a lot of heat and they were at the top of my tolerance level.  I loved it.  It came floating in bean sprouts and sauce that  made the rice fantastic.  Speaking of the rice.  They gave us one small cup to share but it had a nice aroma and subtle flavor.  It might be jasmine rice.  Not sure but it was not just sticky lumpy white rice.  Finally, the scallion pancake.  Loved it.  we almost didn't order it as the sound of it was not exciting.  It was delicious and worth getting.  Get one.  Overall, Joe's delivered what it promised.  Thanks fellow Yelpers for the very helpful reviews and recommendations.
5 My second time been here. The soup bun tastes really nice. But the restaurant is cash only and it's inconvenient. I need to pay transaction fee if I want to use the ATM to withdraw some cash.
5 The soup dumplings are amazing! We also enjoyed the Shanghai noodles and soft shell crab. They were nice to prepare plain lo mein for our daughter.  They are cash only but have an ATM and the prices were reasonable.  They also have a celebrity picture of Chris Mullin!
4 The most authentic and delicious soup dumplings I've ever had. Is it worth it? YES However, there are a few thing you should prepare for: 1. It's cash only 2. They only serve hot tea, not water, so maybe don't go in the summer 3. It can get very crowded in here 4. The dumplings are served very hot
1 My family and I are visiting New York, and we heard this was one of the best places to eat in Chinatown. The food here was great, but the service was some of the worst service we've had. We were sat at a table and then we weren't even asked for a drink order - we were just brought tea. We ordered a order of their pork dumplings, which were awesome, but it took forever to get to our table. We got the dumplings after two tables (which were sat after us) got theirs. They also go their food before we did. One table in particular got three orders or sesame chicken before we got our order of one sesame chicken - they sat down about 10/15 min after us.  We also had to call the waiter over to our table each time we needed something, even though he was standing ten feet away from us just looking at the other tables in his section.  Needless to say, we felt ignored and disrespected by the wait staff. Great food, awful service.
5 Best xiao long bao in the city (and probably east coast). They are literally a religious experience. Crab and pork, just pork, it's all bomb. The chicken and shrimp with plum sauce is also really good. Jellyfish is really refreshing and a nice side dish to share.   Sharing a table with other groups is also really fun and interesting! You also get to see what other people are ordering (and order it yourself upon seeing how good it looks). Service is fast and effective. It's about the food!
5 We ordered the Kung pao chicken and General Tso chicken!  Both were fabulous and probably the best we ever had. First time in Chinatown and this place had excellent reviews we had to check it out.  We didn't air long for a seat or our food.  Please note they only accept cash, which we didn't know beforehand.
4 Already a regular of Joe's Shanghai although I've only been here a month, I'm always after the scallion pancakes and soup dumplings!   Though the skin on the soup dumplings could be a bit thinner for the true soup dumpling texture and taste that I so enjoy, Joe's Shanghai has its own spin on it - there's so much soup packed into each one, and a generous amount of filling/meat in each one too! And at its price in a place like New York (8 soup dumplings for ~$8-9), it really can't get better than this. The scallion pancakes are another favorite dish of mine, partially because of the delicious sweet sauce that they use with it too! They're also really affordable, at around $5 for a stacked plate. Joe's Shanghai has a very modest storefront and only accepts cash, but there's always a line out the door waiting to be seated during peak lunch and dinner hours. I've already taken my friends and my boyfriend here to visit, and they've all loved it.   Great service and quality of food - I'd definitely come back again!
4 We stumbled upon this restaurant while wandering in Chinatown. Prices are OK, service is fast (if a little grumbly) and good is decent. The shrimp & pork shumai are delicious! Not the best dim sum I have ever had, and not the cheapest, but pretty good!
3 Joe's Shanghai was the first place I went to during my trip to New York. We were already at the front of the restuarant 10 minutes before they opened so there were generally no customers.  The service was subpar, as the workers only took our orders and were never to be seen again.. I came with a group of friends and we all came to Joe's for their famous soup dumplings. We ordered both crab and pork soup dumplings and to be frank, were slightly disappointed.  The soup dumplings were just overloaded with soup and barely any meat inside. I've had my fair share of soup dumplings at many different restaurants, but there was no balance between the meat and the soup so I got tired of the taste very quickly. We ordered 5 orders of soup dumplings total, but unfortunately ended up leaving 1 order untouched.  It was a good experience as this restaurant is supposedly famous for their soup dumplings, but I will not be coming back again.
1 This place is a way too expensive. One beef broccoli costs 17.00 + tax.  The rice is not free. In general the rice is free for restaurants.  This place is bullshit.  The only good dish is soup dumplings.  Not recommended!
1 I've been waiting for my food for 35 minutes. Terrible service.  They need to hire more people. I so mad I'm waisted my entire lunch break here.   I don't recommend this place
3 This place always looks crowded. For me, it's overrated. I bought a seaweed fish. They gave me a tray of fish with a carton of white rice. No sauce. $20 something. The fish was so oily i couldnt finish it. I was tender. I really wanted to enjoy it esp bc of the reviews but I wont be going back.
5 I am giving 5 stars for the soup dumpling at this location. I love trying different things when I travel and this is what they are notorious for. and that is exactly what I tried. I was not a fan of a lot of other things on the menu, but that wasn't what attracted me to this restaurant. They are extremely busy so if you expect a sit down and relax atmosphere, this is not the place.
5 Highly recommend the Pork Soup Dumplings.  We ate here twice on our recent trip to NYC. Everything was delicious, but I crave the dumplings.  The noodle soup was really good too.  Oh and the orange peel beef.  The generals Tao's chicken was the best I've ever had. The fried rice was delicious. Highly recommend.  They only take cash and they do community seating which was actually really fun.
4 The soup dumplings are delicious. If you're in NYC you have to give it a try! We will be back to try other stuff soon!
5 So good! Expect to sit with strangers and mingle! The pictures do no justice on how delicious the dumplings are! Expect a wait and bring cash. We got extremely lucky as we were a small party of 2 and came at an awkward time and were seated within 10 minutes. Lots of photos of celebs on the wall, so gaze and look around while your food is being prepped for you
1 I have been looking to trying food in this restaurant based on the reviews and was deeply disappointed.   The soup dumplings were officially the worst I have ever tried and I had tried a lot of them in various parts of the world including close to where they originated in Asia    The corn and chicken soup had no taste and sesame chicken needed resuscitation with lots of sauce to at least have some flavor.   Possiblity I'm not used to this taste and I apologise for this review as I assume huge number of people waiting in line who obviously like the taste but it is not for me.
4 Best soup dumplings I have ever had.  My family would travel to NYC to eat here again.  My husband and daughter loved the fried rice.  Expect to share a table and enjoy some hot tea.
4 The food tastes like any other average restaurant you can find in other places but it's still good. It wasn't a wow experience to me even though I heard so much about them. They also have very big portions. The pictures below were shared by 3 people and we couldn't really finish it all.
3 Over rated, dumplings were good but not great compare to other dumplings places. Noodles had no taste other than heavy soy sauce. 15% tip with no smile from the servers , hurry up and get you out ASAP.
4 It's a very small space hidden inside a dark alley in Manhattan chinatown - very crowded inside and you'll often be seated next to strangers to share a table. Not ideal for intimate dinner dates but that's not why I love it here . Their crab and pork soup dumplings are elysian and the best prices for the quantity and flavor I can find anywhere in nyc . This is my to go spot to satisfy My cravings for soup dumplings; tried a few other dishes on their menu including soups and they were all delicious
4 We were seated almost immediately, probably cause it was just 2 people. Fast service and attentive staff. I dropped my chopstick twice  and they gave me a new pair within 10 secs. We got the crab and pork soup dumpling and the pork meat soup dumpling. I honestly thought the crab meat one was better because there was an extra flavor. Though the flavor did remind me of the canned minced crab meat, tasted good regardless, but the reason why I give it 4 stars.
4 Food was excellent and the overall meal was great except the fact that we did not know it was cash only until the end. Had to go to an at the moment before paying the bill. Caused delays in leaving, which is very frustrating.
5 Always a must do when we come to the city. Been coming here since I was little. Fast service, delicious soup dumplings and other dishes.
3 The entrance is crowded and reeks. Service is mediocre at best. You are seated at a round table with strangers, there not enough room on the table with all the dishes. When asked for forks they just "throw" it on the table. Food regular Chinese. BTW they add 15% service charge and didn't provide receipt had to ask for it.
4 Be prepared to wait.   It's pretty much worth it.    The food was great.  The lo mein had a distinctive Smokey, almost grilled flavor to it.  Really good.   The general tso's chicken was great, crispy on the outside, not the mushy take out kind.     We came for the soup dumplings, and they did not disappoint.  Even my ten years olds devoured them.    Definitely worth going.
5 Order the pork soup dumplings!! Nothing else to say. We also ate the Shanghai noodles and orange chicken (off menu) which were delicious, but the dumplings were the absolute star. Go at an off time so you don't have to wait in a massive line.
5 Came here for the famous soup dumplings.  Incredible food indeed.  This little gem is located on a narrow dirty street.  Inside is old and dated.  Service is quick but not particularly friendly.  Good portions if you are really hungry and it's a great price and value.  The famous soup dumplings, the skin is a bit thick for me, but the flavor and broth of the meat is amazing.  Other dishes are good too, might be slightly oily for the super healthy people.  Definitely worth taking a trip here anytime you are in the city.
4 The experience of eating here highlights our New York experience: its everything you'd think a NY Chinatown experience would be. First off the soup dumplings were incredible and tasty- the chicken broth was so good once you just nipped into it on your soup spoon and the dumpling was so moist and tasty as well. We had fried pork as well as the pepper duck which to me was the best things I had eaten for awhile. The food was definitely why locals kept lining up in the street for.  The place is tiny and you have to share your table with other patrons. It's laughable how rude their service staff is. But what Chinese restaurant doesn't have rude waitstaff? But the time there was part of the whole New York experience and arguably one of our best moments.
3 This is a "get in, get the f out" type of spot where you're seated amongst strangers.  The service is subpar, the food is pretty good and the hustle and bustle of chinatown and new york city in general become apparent in this very busy restaurant.  Expect a wait for 10-20 min to be seated during busy hours but its definitely worth the adventure.  You should know 3 things:   First off -- Know that its "CASH ONLY" so don't forget to bring some fresh dollar bills.  They have an ATM right outside but it probably comes with a heavy cost.   Secondly-- whatever you think it enough for 1 person is probably good for two people.  If you get what you perceive to be "2 entrees" you will not be able to finish all of the food --seriously, its a ton.  Thirdly -- its an authentic Chinese restaurant, get something different --try the duck, maybe get some soup dumplings amongst other things. Live a little and eat something other than orange chicken -_-  yes, I'm judging you. lol
1 I guess i am spoiled since i live in San Francisco and we have an amazing Chinatown. Food was mediocre. Service was so so. Wasnt a fan of the communal table with lazy susans. All in all not for me.
1 This restaurant is only about the money and not about the customer.  They sat many tables in front of us and could careless about the table order.  The experience was ruined due to the excessive unnecessary wait!
5 Put this place on your bucket list to try their soup dumplings!!! They are created with artistic precision, love, and magic. The flavor is unlike any dumplings I've ever had. It felt like I was a king enjoying the world's greatest luxury. Just a taste and your life will be changed for the better. The chef has talent that Michelin star restaurants envy. I dream of and crave these dumplings and would gladly return to New York JUST to eat them again.
5 This is a legitimate Chinese place. But with flavors that aren't too foreign, it is easy for tourists to enjoy themselves while having a new experience. I would definitely recommend the soup dumplings, because that's something that you can't experience at your corner Chinese restaurant. That is, unless, you live in china town in NYC.
4 Crab dumpling is very good same with the chefs special prawns.. Hong Kong style noodles are good too..
5 Ever since I was little my name was Xiao Long Bao and my favorite movie was Spiderman with the great Tobey. Ever since I watched part one I wanted to find the alley with the Chinese lady singing the original spiderman theme song, you know spiderman spiderman. I finally made my way there and was at a ah. While I was rolling around I ran into this restaurant and was like ohhh they sell my name here so I gotta try it. Omg life changing all I did was bite, blow, suck, and take it in whole. I fell in love doing it 8 times at a time with each tray I just couldn't stop. Thank you Tobey for leading me here.  Best Xiao Long Bao. The line is worth the wait.
5 The food was sooooooo goood. Absolutely amazing definitely my favorite Asian restaurant in all of New York. We ordered the sesame chicken, general tso chicken, Mongolian beef, fried rice and the lo mein. Everything was perfect. Another thing is they only accept cash.
4 Soup dumplings were worth the 40 min wait!  Although the skin was thicker than i would like, that flavorful broth was .  Salt pepper filet of fish was meh.  Crispy half duck was meh as well...and the chili fish was good.
2 I was very disappointed at this restaurant. Went there after looking at their reviews from yelp... well it seems like they paid for those reviews. The food was dry and cold. In addition the service was slow and they had major attitude. I love Chinese food and this place does not meet the quality standard. It was ok at its best.   Also, be aware they will put other people in your table if there are 2 seats empty.
4 We had a great time at this place! We love taking out of town guests here- it's a good foodie experience to be sure. I don't eat meat so didn't feel like there were as many options for me as other restaurants similar to this one, but still enjoyed everything I did have. I hope they'll add sweet custard buns to their menu though!!
4 Having recently been to Shanghai just a year prior to coming to Joe's its safe to say that Joe's had a fairly high bar to reach. My friend and I ordered the pork soup dumplings, green onion pancakes, and pork rice cakes, all of which came out in a surprisingly quick amount of time. One thing I was slightly disappointed about was that they didn't have sheng jian bao (pan fried pork buns), which are a traditional staple of almost all Shanghainese restaurants. Regardless, the xiao long bao was so good that upon having our first bite of it, we immediately ordered another two orders of it. The soup dumplings were probably the bets I've had in the states in a long time, and are slightly larger than normal ones (not complaining lol). They're filled with just the right amount of soup: not too much as to overfill your mouth, but also not too little to leave the dumpling feeling empty. On the other hand, their green onion pancakes were a little doughy and could use more green onions in my opinion, but they also had a pleasant crisp to them and had a nice sweet soy sauce that came with it. Finally, the rice cakes were slightly overcooked and felt kinda mushy and uncomfortable to chew, but otherwise had solid flavor. Joe's is most likely famous for their XLB, for good reason, and everything else that I ordered (all traditional Shanghainese cuisine) was decent and stayed pretty close to their roots (aka not Americanized). I would recommend staying away from more Americanized Chinese options (orange chicken, general tsao's chicken, etc) and non-shanghainese food (i.e. Szechuan beef) since this is a pretty traditional Shanghainese restaurant and doesn't really specialize in those cuisines.  5 stars for the xlb, but overall score is bumped down to 4 because the restaurant as a whole seems somewhat one-dimensional (unless they change their name to Joe's XLB or something).
5 It you haven't been here you're missing out. Some of the best dumplings this city has to offer. You will be seated at a table with strangers if you don't come with a large group of your own, so don't be a jerk. It adds to the experience. Enjoy some dumplings and small talk. Welcome to NYC
5 Great Dumplings! Fried rice, pancakes and sesame chicken were delicious! Community seating so you get to sit with other people. Awesome food and loud atmosphere. Downside is the long wait, but well worth it. Bring cash, as they don't except card, and look at your bill, as the tip is already included.
5 So never in my life have I heard of Pork Soup Dumplings, but man am I glad I came into Joe's Shanghai!  These things were incredible!  I also had the combo fried rice and it was also very impressive!   So, something that I love about places like this, and NY in general, is that a lot of seating is "community" seating.  I love being seated at a table full of strangers and meeting new people.  But, something that bugs me about a lot of restaurants in NY is that they take only cash.  In this day and age of Apple Pay and such, who carries cash???  But what do I know?  When you have a constant 45 minute to an hour wait outside your door, guess you can pretty much do as you want...   Other than that, truly great experience!
5 This was our first experience eating in Chinatown and let me tell you it did not disappoint! Thanks to yelp I was able to look at the menu ahead of time and order the sesame chicken and my fiancé ordered the kungpao chicken. Both plates were super rich in flavor, by far the best Chinese restaurant we have ever been to! Be prepared to wait a while location is kind of small, they will also seat you in a table with others but amazing experience will definitely go again!
5 Best Soup Dumplings I've ever had.  They were literally on every table in the restaurant.  Took a little while to get in, but it was definitely worth it!
3 I'm probably the only person that feels this way, but I was a little disappointed. Joe's Shanghai has such phenomenal reviews, and I was so excited to try their soup dumplings. They wrapper was a little too thick, and the filling was dry. Definitely not the best soup dumplings I've eaten. The sautéed green beans were absolutely amazing though. By far the best green beans I've eaten. Maybe I'll just need to return and try different dishes.
2 Yelp published Joe's Shanghai as a dim sum place because someone was uninformed and assumed that this place served dim sum. To clarify, Joe's shanghai is a place for Americanized-shanghainese cuisine and definitely not dim sum. The idea of dim sum is carts with small plates of food being served fresh to the table and what you see is what you get along with tea service. Joe's Shanghai is not any form of dim sum. And my rating for the city location remains at a two-star for food that is always too greasy in comparison to its other locations, as well as, a stuffy environment with table settings and service that don't meet my expectations.
3 I visited Joe's Shanghai on my second night in the city and was super excited because I had heard good things.  We arrived and were hit with that "cash only" rule which was like :/ but luckily we had cash on us so we were able to stay.  We sat down and ordered a bunch of things! To start we received​ a jasmine tea which was nice   We started with the pork&crab soup dumplings. Let me tell you... THESE WERE THE BEST! I was so impressed with the flavors and the textures, It was like a ball of heaven. After that, I definitely​ had some higher standards for this place. We ordered the Szechuan​  beef which was one of the grossest things I have ever seen. It was soupy and definitely​ not what I expected.  Next was the general tso chicken which was good but not above average The fried rice and lo mein were​ also good but a little below average in my opinion.  I will be back here for the soup dumplings but not really for the other things. If you feel passionate about soup dumplings like myself, I definitely​ recommend​ this place.
4 The only thing that separates Joe's from other Chinese restaurants are their crab soup dumplings, so if you're coming here, you better get them, because they're that good.  I've been to the Flushing restaurant before where they really highlight their XLB, and was a bit confused coming to this place when I had to scour the menu to find them (they're under appetizers).  It didn't matter in the end as we ordered one each of the crab and pork soup dumplings.  Unless you really want to try the pork ones, I'd say just go for the crab, as they're so much more flavorful and unique.  The pork ones weren't bad, but they were nothing too special--especially compared to the crab ones.  Between the two of us, two orders of soup dumplings and a plate of string beans was the perfect amount for lunch.  Like with most Chinese restaurants, some of the menu items can be hit or miss, so just be aware that not everything may be as good as the XLB.  The place was pretty crowded for lunch on a weekday, but I swear Chinese restaurants have a hidden spell for getting any sized party to fit at a table no matter how busy they are, so you probably can get a table fairly quickly.  Overall, it's your standard Chinese restaurant that excels at their soup dumplings, but nothing else was that note worthy.
5 Came here in search of soup dumplings and we were not let down! By far the best soup dumplings I have ever had! I already know I will have to come back here each time I am in NYC now! An absolute must! We ordered the pork and crab soup dumplings, which were delicious to say the least. It was hard to choose since everything sounded so good. We also enjoyed the shrimp fried rice and the fried spring rolls, which also had shrimp.  This place is cash only and will seat you family style if your party is small. I came with just one friend and we were seated at a 6 person table with other people. We came around 4pm on a Thursday and it was about half full. I can already tell this place gets packed when it's closer to the regular meal times. Service was fast and the food was fresh and authentic. Still dreaming about these dumplings!!
5 This place is typically packed so while we got to Chinatown, our group went to put our names down for a table. After we got our name in, we opted to go have our "meal" at a nearby noodle shop. After we had some noodles, we returned to Joe's.  Joe's is a fairly small restaurant with not too much seating. We came here with only one thing in mind; soup dumplings!  We ended up ordering some scallion pancakes as well.  The soup dumplings have by far been my favorite. We had an order of the pork dumplings, and the crab ones. They were both delicious, but the crab one was my favorite.  The scallion pancakes were probably the best I've had!   I can't wait to come here and try out other food options; the menu looked wonderful.
5 I was watching the Karate Kid one night and was like wow I want Chinese food. Best decision ever. Went down to Pell St and got some love from my main man Joey Shanghai. They have the best shrimp in the state most likely from the Hudson River and their chopsticks are very easy to use they always have a custom pair with rubberbands they give to their most experienced customers. Xièxiè, Joe, Xièxiè (yes that is authentic Chinese LeAndre is a very cultured, classy man from a classy family in the hills).
4 Get the soup dumplings and get lots of them!  My share of our dinner summed to 6 soup dumplings and I probably could have eaten more.  The other dishes are a bit hit or miss.  I'd even say there is no shame in only getting soup dumplings!!!  Scallion Pancakes: Tasted freshly made in-house.  Some places seem to get the pre-made stuff.  Crispy all around.  The sweet soy sauce dip and hot sauce (on the side) helped cut the richness.  Pork Meat Soup Dumplings: Probably the best I've had and I've had a lot!  There is just so much soup in these babies.  You can tell when you suck them dry and there is tons of floppy skin left.  I appreciate that the top dough is a bit thick, allowing for extraction from the bamboo steamer without leakage. Though I do prefer using chopsticks rather than the metal tongs, since the pointy edges can also puncture it.  Pan Fried Crispy Noodle w/ Beef: The few bites of crispy noodles along side soggy noodles were great.  Ample amount of tender beef, tons of veggies and a thick sauce. However, I wasn't a fan of the presentation.  It came out with gravy spread all around, leaving very few crispy edges.  I like when places pour it on at your table and focus on creating only a tiny pile in the middle.  Crispy Pork Chop with Pepper Salt: Kinda disappointing.  The pork chop bits were really tough.  Also, random bone and gristle made for unpleasant surprises when eating, since it's hard to see beneath the deep fried coating.  Worth passing by next time.
5 Kung Pao Chicken is amazing. Dumplings are delish. Great family owned restaurant.. great experience!
5 best chinese food in the whole usa !!! the pork soup dumplings are a must and are better than any other place i've had. and i've had a LOT of chinese food and dumplings in my life. i will always return to joes whenever i go to NYC. the place is always busy but the move pretty fast so the wait isn't super long
5 Ugh so good. Give me all the dumplings. *Tip: when  eating dumplings use the spoon to catch all the juice. 1. It's delicious 2. It will get all over you if you don't. Authentic Chinese- simply delicious. Yeah you'll wait 30-40 minutes but it's worth the wait! OH! Big thing to note: they only accept cash which is odd BUT they have a ATM right by the door.
4 Was good, lo mein and sesame chix was great.  Long wait. Dim sum palace has better dim sum
5 Best Chinese I have ever had.   We ordered: -soup dumplings -scallion pancakes -veggie lo main -chicken with veggies -crispy beef
4 Great authentic Chinese food option in Chinatown! Highly recommend! All 5 of us enjoyed it, cozy atmosphere! Very good and prompt service!
5 Still my favorite dumpling restaurant! The soup dumplings are huge! They barely fit in my spoon! The meat and the soup have so much good flavor it's hard to compare to other establishments! I've been here once before but man I'm so happy I was able to try this again! It was so good, we almost came again! I believe they have several locations but this one in Chinatown has to be the best.   It's true, if you have a small party, they will seat you at a family style table in order to move guests in and out as fast as possible. It's not too bad if you just want to enjoy your food and go. I noticed there were many solo guests who didn't mind the round table company.   The service was great! We were in and out of there within 45 minutes it seems.
5 Hand's down the best xiao long baos I've ever had! The XLBs are huge, definitely not like those dainty ones from Din Tai Fung. The soup inside is flavorful and piping hot -- be careful and try not to burn yourself! The scallion pancake is also highly recommended.   This was one of the cheaper meals we had in NYC, probably because it's located in the chinatown area. Beware, this casual restaurant gets super crowded. Sharing a table with strangers is a normal thing here, so get comfy! Or you can wait hours/ years (exaggerating) for your own table to open up. The servers really try to get you in and out -- don't feel offended, that's just how things roll here! Plus it adds to the fast and efficient service.   SOLID 5/5. Can't wait to come back!
5 The hype is real.   Price $21.00 Service: quick and efficient  Food: scallion pancakes are the die for. Had their #2 water dumpling, pancake, and some fried bun with condensed milk. You can get the other two anywhere BUT THEIR SCALLION PANCAKE WITH THEIR SAUCE=5stars
2 Didn't like the service, got scoffed at when asking what a dish contained, which did end up containing something we didnt like. Was hastily brought the bill. 15% service charge was included in the bill, not really appreciated.
5 Went to Chinatown and stopped by this restaurant for lunch the last time I visited NYC! The wait was 20 minutes during lunch time but it's worth it! The food was delicious especially the dumplings! Huge portions and not expensive! Great restaurant for families too!
5 Their soup dumpling is absolutely amazing! My friend recommended me to come to this place, and I thought sure, would love to try some soup dumpling. They have a fairly long waiting line, luckily, they required the whole group to arrived in order to sit down. So I didn't end up waiting long since I was there with one other person. It's a communal round table, so if you feel uncomfortable sitting in the same table with strangers, definitely not the best place.   I ordered the soup dumpling and crab dumpling together with scallion pancake. The dumplings are absolutely the best! The dumplings were very big in size and the soup was great! I really enjoyed my time there despite the busy environment. One of my favorite dumpling places in NYC. The scallion pancake was a little too thick and oily. I was hoping for a thinner and crisper one, however, the overall experience was wonderful!   A side note, they don't accept card so you should bring cash if you will be visiting!
5 Truly amazing! Joe's is located on a small street in Chinatown. We arrived a little after 5 PM and there was already a 25 minute wait. That's when you know the place is good!   Joe's looks like your typical Chinatown restaurant. There isn't anything special about the interior, but the emphasis is placed on the quality of their food. Note: they only take cash!  [ Pork Soup Dumplings ] Our group of four ordered four sets of soup dumplings. Each set is served in a dim sum box and comes with 8 soup dumplings. The soup dumplings were bigger than I expected and they spill over the soup spoon. The skin of thick but easy to break apart and the flavor of the soup is deliciously rich. My friend taught me her technique! First, you bite a hole into the soup dumpling and drain the soup into the spoon. Then you dip the rest of the dumpling into the provided vinegar and chase it all down with the soup.   [ Scallion Pancakes ] Very crispy and oily! These served as great "sponges" to soak up any soup that spilled from the soup dumplings.
2 This is one of the worst restaurants in Chinatown, that is clearly resting on its laurels from years ago.  The Grade Pending sign in the window should have been enough of an ominous sign.  I joined some Chinese friends so ignored it.  Despite my "authentic" hosts, food was very unsatisfactory:  noodles full of grease (uncommon for true Shanghai cuisine), an old-looking mock duck, and overly battered shrimp.  Most disappointing were the soup dumplings (which used to be their calling card):  poorly constructed, way too big for the soup spoon, soup drips out before you even take a bite.  Staff is very inattentive in service.  Cash-only makes it a total rip-off.  The other disturbing sign:  the large number of non-Asian diners, clearly tourists who don't know any better what good Chinese food can taste like.  I had indigestion all night and a compelling need to share this review.
5 I'm laughing reading the reviews for this place. People are giving them less stars because they're crowded (because the food is great and not their fault), because they do communal seating (this allows more people to be seated), automatically charge gratuity (a ton of their customers are tourists who wouldn't tip otherwise and being a waiter here must be one of the most stressful experiences of all time), and are cash only (this is completely reasonable and they have an atm at the front for your convenience.)   Soup dumplings are incredible, scallion pancakes and crispy and perfect, Lo mein is smoky and wonderful, prices are beyond reasonable for a place this hyped and the portions are massive. My coworkers and I routinely go after work and are more than happy to wait because it's always worth it!
4 Pretty solid soup dumplings! Came here with parents and ordered the regular soup dumplings, crab soup dumplings, drunken chicken, and Shanghai stir fried noodles. Soup dumplings had excellent flavor and I'm partial to crab flavored ones, they did those great. Also thought the drunken chicken was done really well, not too strong but just enough wine flavoring to make it a great dish.  Would not get the black bean sauce noodles though...got those once for take out and it was pretty off. Overall solid restaurant!
2 Was expecting better since they put the word "Shanghai" onto their restaurant name. For a Shanghainese who had countless authentic soup dumplings in SH, the ones served in Joe's Shanghai is very very mediocre. Their pork and crab filling does taste more fresh than your other options in Chinatown. However, the size of the soup dumpling was what had me shook. One equals two of those in Shanghai! They are way too big. The pleating was not done nicely either. The worst part was the skin. Their skin were way too thick and unenjoyable to chew on. I tried their other auth Chinese food as well. Either was too oily or had loads of MSG added. The restaurant makes you sit with complete strangers. Ppl from my neighboring seats ordered Americanized Chinese food like "genera Tao chicken" and "mangolia beef". Maybe that's a better choice.
5 Start spreading the news..... actually it's not news this place has been on the off beaten map for a while now and it is known for its dumplings (Chinese crab and pork broth dumplings) to be exact and they do not miss the mark. Definitely worth splitting your wooden chopsticks open. Cash only and 15% gratuity added at end of check. But they have free views of gold fish and tea.
5 Simply amazing. Small, crowded restaurant with a long line out the door, but so worth the wait. Best soup dumplings ever in life!!!  First time to have a scallion pancake and I haven't stopped trying to find another as good. I guess I'll have to return to New York soon.
5 Joe's Shanghai is the place to go in Chinatown. It's cheap, it's delicious, and they have a menu that's expansive enough that everybody in your party will be happy. I've been here many times, and my go-to is the soup dumplings.  The most important thing to know is that you should be prepared for a pretty long wait if you're here for dinner time. For a table for two, and it was not even the most crowded I've seen it, I had about a 25 minute wait. When we were able to be seated, we shared a table with 4 other people... Which was kind of tight, but I can't fault the place for being popular.  On the walls around the restaurant, there are photos of every celebrity you can think of with the owner. It's dim, it's cozy, its surprisingly quiet for a place that is standing room only.   The food came out surprisingly quickly for a place that was this packed- and the food was good. I only come here every so often because of the weight, but I've never regretted the wait.
5 Review is only for the not so xiao, xiao long baos! Really though these are some of the hugest xlb dumplings I've ever had and coming from California I've been to tons of Chinese restaurants in my lifetime.  The pork ones are pretty good but the pork/crab ones are soooooo juicy and delicious. Highly recommend springing for the crab ones because they're wayyy more flavorful and they actually do put a good amount of crab. They add some yummy steamed shredded cabbage which is nice because most places don't give anything with their baos.  I liked the crab pork dumplings so much I came back two more times in my one week in NY. Nothing else on the menu really impressed me in addition to the fact the prices for everything else seemed too high.  Still will keep coming back and doing my takeout bao orders when I'm in NY.
3 We had a good time here although we aren't completely certain we'd come back. We enjoyed the food, but just weren't super impressed in the end. Felt underwhelmed. That being said, or group did have a fun time, just be prepared to be seated family style with other patrons at large tables!
5 Been coming to this place for 20 years. It's a solid magical place . Legendary birth place of the American made soup dumplings. Join the club
5 With all the hype, Joe's really could've fell hard. But I was really impressed by the authenticity, the quick and friendly service, and the overall operation. Menu large and hits every American's taste buds as well as more traditional Chinese offerings. Waiters work fast but offer opinions on favorites and best ofs. I ordered quick and had sake, crab soup dumpling, cold sesame noodle, and soup pancake. Everything was good and I left still burping and tasting the meal (in a good way). Pancake essentially a latke  with some chives and had a great dipping sauce. But dipping it in the sesame noodle sauce worked well as well. Speaking of sesame noodle, the quantity is something else. They really pile high and soak it in the sauce. Pro tip is to add tons of chili sauce. Perfect noodles and a nice change of pace from the entirely hot meal from food to tea. The soup dumplings are as good as advertised.  Quite big and not too fishy so good for even the anti-fish eaters. Sauce overly vinegary for me but others seemed to like it. But in all the dumplings had such thick skin but a bounce to them that is just so rare and a perfect sight. Cash only but again super cheap for the quality and quantity. Definitely will get busy but come on weekday and you can sneak in under 20 minutes. Only complaint is the communal tables regardless of numbers (all seat 4 or 6) but I guess it's a family type of restaurant so makes sense so seat big rather than bars or tiny areas. Joe's lives up to the hype and is well well worth the wait.
5 There are about a million other reviews of this place but it's definitely one of those places you go if you're touring NYC. Definitely go just to try their soup dumplings. It is a small and popular restaurant so there's usually a wait and you get seated with other parties. I got lucky and got my own table but that's not usually how it goes.   Also this is just a tip so you show up and look like a professional soup dumpling eater:  They are also known as Xiao Long Bao (XLB)! To eat it, use the tongs and grab the bao by the tip and place onto your soup spoon. Bite a small hole on the edge of the bao and slurp up some of the soupy goodness. Take some of the vinegar soy sauce they provide and pour some in the hole of the bao. Put the whole thing in your mouth and taste heaven on Earth!
5 The daughter INSISTED I go here while in NYC and I'm glad I did.  Would've been much better to go with someone else, but going by myself is better than not going at all.  Since it was just me, they seated me at a communal table.  There was a group of 3 friends, and another 2 oriental women.  I ordered the soup dumplings, which were SO VERY GOOD!  I struck up a conversation with the 3 friends, hoping that they'd offer to let me try some of their food.  It was VERY obvious that they'd ordered WAAAAY too much.  But when they didn't offer, I thought they'd be taking the leftovers home with them...  But they didn't!  It was sooooo sad to watch all that food go to waste, and I hadn't had a chance to try any of it!  The oriental women did offer, and I tried a soup that they had which was better than I'd expected it to be.  The building itself is kind of a dump, but the food was outrageously good.  And NOT extremely expensive, like most things in NYC!
5 Those soup dumplings  are in my top 20 favorite things I've ever put in my mouth.  That's coming from a non meat /non pork - high vegetable mostly raw vegan southwestern freakzoid that talks much shit about mysteriously sourced food.  I wholesomely love those dumplings with every cell of my body.  I want to be the soup dumplings.  I must become them again.     I waited forty minutes to be seated as a single diner to a communal round table deep in the back of the restaurant.  I was crammed in with all the other non Chinese people.   I didn't care about any of that.  None of it bothered me, the service was whatever.  Those dumplings were all I wanted and needed in that time and I didn't know it till I had them. Juicy, popping delicious explosiveness happened inside me.    I ordered more food but those soup dumplings were all I need.  Those dumplings are all I need.  I want your dumplings Joe!  I need them.  Ah!
5 We had a great experience. We came for the soup dumplings and were not disappointed. We also ordered a shrimp fried rice that was fantastic as well. Cash only and communal seating, but neither of those things bothered us. Food came quickly, but we never felt rushed.
5 Loved it! The crispy noodles are amazing.  Wish the they didnt use so much pork gelatin in most things they made. Would have loved to try their soup dumplings but they have pork in almost everything they serve.. delicious food otherwise.
5 The restaurant is a very busy one, with a size being small as well. So keep in mind that you'll be waiting. They have small tables and also large tables. We had a party of 8 so it was quite a while. They seat people as soon as a party leaves but it varies by size, not by the order you placed your name. We waited for a little over an hour and got seated at a large table but it was community style. The other half of the table was with strangers but I personally liked it because food brings all types of people together. *truth* you obv don't have to talk to them if you don't want to.   What's great about eating at an Asian restaurant is that there is a dish for everyone. So, I am pescatarian, so I eat seafood but not any traditional meats like red and chicken. So I ordered a shrimp noodles dish. There was broccoli and other vegetables but the noodles come hard. And you have to mix the shrimp and veggies together with the sauce to make the noodles not as hard. But it was honestly one of the better dishes, even the meat eaters agreed. I didn't get to try other Chinese restaurants in the area because we didn't have a whole lot of time in New York, but I would def recommend this spot!
4 Your in China Town....Joe takes you to Shanghai, China...it's busy, but not crazy yet. The two of us are three back from being called to the "Diners Table". But, they call "six" of us up and suddenly your transported to China...you sit at a large round table sitting all parties. A printed letter of the English (you think) alphabet is placed in front of each group. No one converses with any "outsiders". It's as if you are sitting at a private table, but it's not private. The menu looks like it's written in a different language. The English writing seems foreign to you. You choose two cups of sake, a Szechuan Beef and a Shrimp Lo-Mein. The beef is tender medium rare perfectly cooked. The beef is in a Szechuan sauce most delicious (Gen.Tso married to Miss Hoisin..:). Our Sake was delivered in small odd looking bottles. But this Sake very good!!!..:) The Shrimp Lo Mein was tasty; The shrimps though smaller than desired, were accompanied by crispy delicious bean sprouts. Waiters come at you like Ninja Warriors, seeming to drop in and out of sight from the ceiling..:) We had plenty of leftovers to take back to our Temporary Villa. Oranges brighten the end of this fun meal. As you leave somewhere near 7pm, you see the crowd of people (many Asian) waiting with great humility (humility is not thinking less of yourself; it is thinking of yourself less."..:) to be called to the Round Table. Thanks for reading.  Avram Arthur Chan
4 Soup dumplings were delicious. Scallion pancake - so good!  Service was...think of the crazy soup guy from Seinfeld. Tip was included so they don't really care to give good service, you are there for the food not for the service.
5 Long lines (there's a reason for the long lines).  Sharing tables with strangers.  But WORTH the wait.  Simply the best Chinese restaurant in NYC, period!!!  I've been to Shanghai, China at their best soup dumpling (Xiao Long Bao) place and it totally sucked compared to Joe's.
5 I've been coming here for about 10+ years now...introduced to by friends. Best soup dumplings I have had by far...and I've searched, believe me. The mixed soup dumplings, shanghai fried rice with a side of scallion pancakes...something that will immediately put you in a delicious and comforting food coma. If you're a local, it's the perfect lunch/dinner; a bit challenging when you're coming from NJ, but parking isn't too bad considering regulations in NYC are strict. You'll always find a spot in China Town! If you go on a weeknight, especially wknd night, expect to wait an hour for a table (a table that you may or may not share with others). Lunch gets quite busy as well, but you're in the clear if you arrive before 12pm. Absolutely worth the wait, regardless.
3 Standard hong Kong style food. Service is ok. Noisy. The pot rice is good. The beef chow fun is so so, you can skip it.
5 I was craving wonton noodles one night and was going to go to tasty hand pulled noodles only to realize it's not on their menu. This was my other choice and boy am I glad I came. Omg, where have I been?!  I had the wonton noodles and the Shanghai soup dumplings (Xiao long bao) and I'm in LOVE. The texture of the noodles is thin and perfectly... I don't even know how to describe it. Al dente? The portion comes in two sizes, small and large with the difference being 4 or 5 wonton respectively and amount of noodles. The shrimp wontons are a legit size and full of flavor and juicy.  The soup dumplings are like none I've ever had on new York city. The skin is amazingly thin and full of soup with a variety of flavors!  After being crazed about the food, I must say the decor and service definitely sealed the deal for me. The restaurant made me feel like I was eating in someone's home.
4 Pretty good, attentive service for a Chinese restaurant. Food is prompt and pretty delicious. A great noodle selection, along with some other dishes. Clean. Well priced.
5 Second time try this place and ordered differently. Most of the dishes are good expect the beef stew with rice cake
4 Best item on the menu is their wonton noodle soup. The shrimp in the wonton is fresh and crispy and the noodles are springy! Only complaint is the beef chow fun was average and couldn't compare to the wonton noodle soup.
4 The restaurant name is a noodle village, but the congee is the best food here. Any type of congee is great and sharing xiao long bao with your friends is also nice.
5 Ordered shrimp dumplings, beef brisket duet noodle soup with fish balls, scallion pancakes (omg you have to order), and shrimp dumpling lo mein. One word - bangin.   Oh and I ordered cold soy milk to go.   Definitely coming back..
4 Walked in on a Saturday morning, 11am, when we were craving some authentic Hong Kong egg noodles.   There was no wait for a table for 2.   - Hong style noodles "duet" style - brisket and prawn dumpling or "shui gao"  Noodles were al dente and was reminiscent of those in Hong Kong. The order came with a good amount of noodles, meats and steamed kai lan vegetables, drizzled with oyster sauce.  Brisket pieces had some amount of fat but that's pretty typical. Best part about this is you can choose which 2 meats you'd like to have with your noodles  - steamed dumplings (xiao long bao)  These had a lot of "soup" in them. The fillings were flavourful and piping hot.  Only setback was the thick skin especially the knot at the top.   I'd return for the noodles (rating is more for the authenticity of the noodles and the speedy service) but for the dumplings - I'd stick to dtf or other places (I've yet to find anywhere stellar in NYC!)
4 I came to Noodle Village with great hopes. For some reason, this is a part of Mott Street that I rarely patronize, probably because I've always thought the restaurants here are tourist grade old school Chinese restaurants. I came here on a recommendation and quickly noticed that it's indeed a Cantonese-style noodle and rice joint, however, they also sell Shanghai soup dumplings and clay pot casserole rice. These aren't usually offered at noodle/rice/congee restaurants so it was interesting to me. In fact, a picture of soup dumplings is right on the front cover of their menu.  As such, we ordered pork soup dumplings, a preserved meat clay pot rice, and a basic wonton noodle soup with noodles.  The pork soup dumplings were very disappointing. The six dumplings contained meat that was a bit of a crumbled mess inside the wrapper and had little soup. The wrapper itself was slick and shiny, more like a shui gao wrapper than a soup dumpling wrapper. I can forgive this if the entire dumpling turned out to be tasty. Unfortunately it wasn't and it seemed that there were too many elements that were off to save it.  Next, the basic wonton soup was a winner. The soup had the right amount of chicken and fishy flavor that the classic soup should have and the noodle had nice crunchy texture. The wontons were neatly wrapped and contained a clump of pork packed with a whole shrimp. I would think that any other soup noodle derivative served here would as good.  Finally, the best of the group of dishes we ordered was the preserved meat clay pot casserole. The clay pot was flat and wide, allowing for a nice, extra-large, oily crispy rice to form on the bottom. There was Chinese sausage, preserved pork belly, and liver sausage included in the mix. When the sweet soy was added, the flavor was boosted to the heavens. This, in my opinion is now the best clay pot rice in Manhattan's Chinatown. I loved the oily, savory flavors and would come back to try their other variants.   In the end, although Noodle Village is known for soup dumplings, you should really go for the clay pot rice. It is divine and well worth your money.
4 Highly recommend this go to and popular lunch location for not just noodles, but also soup dumplings as well as congee!  Order the soup dumplings. They are everything and more. Very nice staff. On Sundays, it can be very very busy, so plan accordingly.  A go to spot for as long as I am in the area.
5 Their wonton noodle soup and the chicken congee (I forgot the exact name) is the way to go!! Very authentic Cantonese food. There is always a wait on Friday night but it moves fast so worth it! Will come back for wonton noodle soup again! (Or maybe just wonton!!)
4 Quick and moderately price lunch summons soup dumplings. #71 Shrimp dumplings wonton traditional Cantonese noodle soup, regular size $6.25  I was immediately seated for a party of one.  My hot tea was refilled and my order was served in a timely matter.  The noodles were okay as I had better quality egg noodles elsewhere.  There is a Yelp mobile check-in offer.  As per their business card and takeout menu "no MSG" but my order tasted a slight hint of MSG embedded.  Wait staff are fluent in Cantonese- yes, Cantonese is still alive!
5 Tastes really cantonese. I enjoy the food. It would be better if there were more dianxin
3 Came here at 1 pm and man it was crowded. We waited for 15 minutes before we got a table.  Beware - you might get seated on a bigger table with other strangers looking at you eat. It's normal for a Chinese restaurant though.  We ordered the combo set   1) Hong Kong noodle soup with beef brisket and fish ball: the noodles weren't that great, I've tasted better. The soup was OK for me but I didn't enjoy the beef brisket at all. Even though they did give an abundance of beef, most of it were tendons which I didn't like and a lot were fat. The fish ball barely tasted like fish - just plain flour. The fish cake is however, a lot better.  2) Dry Hong Kong noodles with wonton and beef brisket: Noodles were a little too hard and the sauce was not authentic. The sauce lacks the normal kick that usual Hong Kong noodles have. The wontons are alright, a bit dry.   3) hot soy milk - tastes good but over priced
5 They were great about food allergies. Such a delicious meal, just be ready to order quickly, not terribly patient service. Food comes quickly. Fast delicious and worth everything.
4 Quick fast Chinese foods that actually pretty authentic Cantonese food. This place opens pretty late and got plenty of varieties to choose from. The price is reasonable and the portion is not bad. Nothing much to say but it one of the open late good places to get a mid night snack.
1 The cashier lady was very rude. When the bill came and hand over my credit card, she told me "cash only" with an attitude, hand it back and walked away. Outside the door display "We accept Credit Card" so I was a little confused. I went to the cash register and asked her what was the problem??  she said $25 minimum (my check was $24.90) with an attitude again. I just held it in and paid the damn bill in cash (too bad on collecting 3x rewards points!). My question that time, isn't tip add on in the total?? I mean, most of restaurants are okay with it. I mean its just .10 cents difference, not including tip!! So... REMEMBER, CREDIT CARD $25 MINIMUM! NOT $24.99! and don't forget to TIP!  LOL
4 I stopped by Noodle Village with a friend. Honestly, there are so many good/decent restaurants in Chinatown that finding a place to eat becomes super easy (who would have ever thought). I ordered the #83 Beef Brisket Noodle Soup HK Style for myself and split an order of the Pork Soup Dumplings. For appetizers, some crispy fried fish skin was given to us. This was actually much tastier than I expected! It was perfectly flaky and personally, I liked the fishy taste that it had. The soup noodles were delicious as well-the noodles were extremely thin and were nicely cooked. Prior to Noodle Village, I had the pork soup dumplings at Joe's Shanghai. I must say that I still preferred the ones from Joe's Shanghai to the ones we ordered at Noodle Village. The pork dumplings here were still good, but they were a bit too sweet for my taste.  As I mentioned earlier, with so many restaurants in Chinatown, finding a place to eat may actually be overwhelming. I would recommend going to Noodle Village and ordering their soup noodle dishes over their pork dumplings.
5 You won't go wrong ordering any dish here. It's very authentic Hong Kong style noodles.  Hot tea or ice water is offered when you sit down. They come around and refill your tea cup. No extra charge. But you can also order beer, Bruce Cost ginger beer, HK style tea, soy milk, Mango punch, etc.   Steamed rice rolls with hoisin and peanut sauce: the mixture of the 2 sauces is like a match made in heaven. The rice rolls are not soggy and are steamed perfectly.  White clams with garlic: steamed clams with fried garlic and dabs of soy sauce. Every clam was open (no bad clams on the dish)  Braised beef brisket and wonton noodles: mom is a very picky eater and she said this is just like the ones she had in Hong Kong. They skim the fat, so the soup is not oily at all. The wontons have fresh shrimp and pork to create that scrunch when you bit into it. Without the shrimp, the wonton is just mush from the pork. Best wontons too! It's very authentic Hong Kong style noodles. The noodles are al dente, not soggy like other restaurants.  Steam Shanghai soup dumplings: Although soup dumplings is a Shanghai dish, they do it justice at this Cantonese noodle venue. Each morsel is an explosion of flavor. Dip the dumpling in the vinegar dumpling sauce and put the whole dumpling in your mouth. Let the juices explode in your mouth! Make sure it's not too hot. Don't confuse soup dumplings with dumpling soup. Soup dumplings have the soup INSIDE the dumpling. Dumpling soup are dumplings in a bowl of broth.  Congee: it's a rice porridge that can be mixed with different toppings. sampan, fish, or minced beef are are classics. They have a vegetarian Congee with mustard greens and pumpkin that's not available elsewhere. Sampan has squid, tripe, beef, pork, and  peanuts. Chinese parents and grandparents would make Congee when you're under the weather or you've lost your appetite. It's comfort food.  Rice casseroles: we like the fish casserole. Mom likes the Chinese sausage with preserved meats. They have a special sweetened soy sauce that goes with the rice casserole. Scrape the crispy rice from the edge and bottom of the pot. It adds an extra crunch. That's actually my favorite part.
5 I was craving soup dumplings, so before I arrived in the city, I researched the best soup dumpling spot in Chinatown. Sadly, by the time I made my way over to Mott St., that place was no longer accepting tables so after a hurried (and panicked) Yelp search, I found Noodle Village.   As is usual in Chinatown restaurants, we were promptly seated and the piping hot tea was brought out immediately. As is also custom at Chinese restaurants, the food arrived quickly. We ordered a scallion pancake, pork and crab soup dumplings, and to try something different, curry brisket with Hong Kong style lo mein.   Surprisingly, this was my first time trying a scallion pancake and it was delicious! Light and perfectly crispy, I could have eaten at least three more. The soup dumplings were DIVINE! That fatty, savory broth inside the dumpling, paired with the black vinegar and ginger, omg-- my mouth is watering just typing this! I'll admit that I do need lessons on appropriate dumpling etiquette. Is it supposed to be eaten out of a soup spoon or from that mini saucer? Haha either way, they were devoured. The curry brisket with Hong Kong style lo mein was also wonderful. I haven't had much curry in Chinese cuisine, but since I told my bf to pick a dish we had both never had, we went for it. It wasn't something that I would have picked out myself, but so glad we ordered it. The noodles were light and bouncy, the curry flavor was perfectly balanced, and the brisket was super tender. It was served with a light broth which I wound up sipping/pouring on the noodles (I didn't know the exact purpose lol), but I made it work.   So glad I found this gem! Next time I'm in the city, I'll most certainly be back.
3 It was ok. I got shrimp wonton noodle soup, it was fine, nothing I would order again. daughter got the devilish soup, she enjoyed but said nothing special, my moms chicken fried rice on the other hand was amazing! Delicious! There was a funny smell when you walk in. I wouldn't return.
4 Really good authentic chinese food at a phenominal price. Such a varied menu too, you'll get just about any style of noodle soup or entree that you're craving, and the dim sum is all day...huge win there! Staff is quick about geting your order and food out to you as well. The inside isn't huge, but not cramped; actually thought it was comfortable and well spaced.  They tout themselves to have the best wonton soup in the city, and I have to say they may be onto somthing. I customized my own soup since I wanted both the shrimp wontons and dumplings with some veggies. Pro tip, mix in some of the hot chili sauce and you'll be wanting another bowl! The broth wasn't very stout, but was warm and flavorful, wontons/dumplings had generous pieces of shrimp, veggies were tasty, and the noodles were abundant and had a good firmness to them that I like in my noodle soup. I will say I didn't notice the difference between teh wontons or dumplings, so I think it's about the same either way. Also got the shao mai and soup dumplings. Soup dumplings were so well done, didn't rip and spill out the soup, very moist and rich in flavor. Definitely some of the best I've had. Shao mai was done well, very meaty and flavorful as well, just wish it was more traditional and also had the shiitake mushroom on the inside as well.  One of the more clutch aspects of this place is that they not only take card, but Amex as well! So many places down in Chinatown only take cash, so it was nice to see a place with such good food accommodate on something so simple. There are other places with as good of dim sum, but the star of the show for sure was the wonton soup and the price. Bill total was only $21, and was more than full by the end of the meal.
5 Really really good food authentic Chinese food here! Ordered the rice bowl, beef congee, and DUMPLINGS (so good!) The place was packed, but we were able to be squeezed in. Overall each person paid around $14 for a GREAT meal in the City! Would totally come here again!
5 This is my favorite restaurant ever, and has been for many years.  The food is amazing (and cheap!!! this place is super affordable!) with such unique flavors--every time I'm here, I have to order black egg and fish congee, soup dumplings, and curry lo mein. The curry sauce is unlike anything I've ever had from a restaurant--I crave it almost weekly.  Everyone on the staff is really nice, and the environment is great for both groups AND intimate meetups. And it's not an overly commercialized place yet, so it's not too chaotic.  Do yourself a favor and go here. You won't regret it.
4 Good soup dumplings. They are more on the sweeter side. However, I think there are better soup dumplings out there in China town.   Shrimp fried rice is excellent my spoon kept going for more. It's seasoned just right.   Beef chow fun is also great. Noodles are chewy and delicious. Comes with big chunks of beef.   Very solid Chinese food. Would definitely come again and prices are great!
5 I love this place. The beef chow fun is great. They have a rice noodle with peanut and hoisin, sesame sauce reminds me of H. K. Wonderful soups. They cook the Chinese broccoli just right. I go there often and bring friends.
5 Ordered the pan fried noodles with chicken and shrimp, split the dish between 2 people. Excellent food & service
4 Vegetable fried rice is delicious and the flavors are. It too heavy. Typically I feel bloated after eating Chinese food, but this place did not make me feel this way and the food was a lighter in texture and not as soy sauce heavy meaning you can add as much soy sauce as u desire on the side.  The friend rice was a hit for our table and the friend dumplings. I wasn't a huge fan of the dumplings with soup inside but that's because I don't like soft doughy items- the rest of the group raved about these dumplings.  Definitely a great alternative option of a restaurant if the wait at Joe's Shenanigans is too long of a wait.
4 If I had an emptier stomach I probably would have finished all of my ramen. It was pretty good though
5 One of the best restaurants I've ever been to in Chinatown. Delicious food, fresh, clean, very good service. Everything was excellent and I definitely would recommend others to check it out!
5 During my trip to Chinatown, a friend recommended this place and it did not disappoint! I was so surprised when I first walked in to see no line and to be seated immediately. The price for each item on the menu took me by surprise because everything was so cheap. For an Asian establishment, I was really taken back by how nice the staff was LOL. Fortunately, I spoke Cantonese which made things a bit easier.   First off, I ordered some soup dumplings. They were hands-down the best soup dumplings I've ever had. The wrapping was thin but thick enough to not break when picking them off the tray. They came with a house sauce which was made perfectly to my liking--some ginger, soy sauce, and I think some vinegar? I also ordered a simple wonton noodle soup which was very light and exactly what I wanted. Everything was seasoned perfectly and tasted so authentic. I was so impressed and will definitely come back in the future.
5 I love the wonton noodle soup from here. If you are ever in Chinatown and have the craving for some, definitely visit this spot. In Chinatown, I think sometimes you may have to endure the coldness of a waiter/ waitress to get to really good food. But Noodle Village is definitely not one of those places; The service has never let me down.   I've also gotten the soup dumplings from here once. They're tasty, but in my opinion, I think they are better places in Chinatown for soup dumplings. But if you're here, don't hesitate to try them!   Will definitely come back and recommend.
3 The food was ok, nothing outstanding. Price seems reasonable. Some of the servers were friendly.  However, our cups came dirty and later there was hair in my porridge. How disgusting is that? Will never come again. They didn't charge the porridge on us in the end, never apologized tho.
5 This is the only place you should go to for Chinese Cantonese cuisine in Manhattan and the only restaurant I can trust for some good Chinese food.  These are all 10/10 for me lol Xiaolong bao - if you love yourself, order it. It's on par with Din Tai Fung, if not even better. Wonton noodle soup Rice roll in hoisin and peanut sauce Steam green Chinese veggies Soy milk Lemon ice tea  I would most definitely be back again, when I visit NYC again. And btw, the cleanest restaurant and restroom thus far in Manhattan.
3 I came here a month or so with a group of friends and did not have a pleasant experience.   I had beef stew with fried noodles and was disappointed. The beef stew was very dry and hard to eat, flavor was also lacking. My friend who had the same dish as me also said the same thing.   The soup dumplings were also a bit lacking in flavor. Although many have said that the soup dumplings are great, it was not to my liking.   I also felt that we were being rushed to order and finish eating.
5 Food was great. I belive it's very well known for congee which I didn' get but got other stuff which was great. We waited a while since the place was really packed but well worth it. The staff was very courteous as well while we waited.
5 Came for a quick lunch. Their wontons are as good as any I've had in Hong Kong, broth was very good with no msg. I also had a vegetable and a "Cheung fun" (dough), which was not bad.  Highly recommend if you want HK style wonton and egg noodles.
4 Noodle me this, Batman!  With their extensive menu, Noodle Village is a great addition to Chinatown!  Noodle shops come and go, but there are a few steadfast ones and I hope this one stays for a long time!  Hong Kong style noodles, traditional Cantonese wonton noodles, congee, shanghai snacks and even ramen are covered by their diner-sized menu.  So it was a little hard to decide what to get on first time here.  It was a hot summer day, but we decided to go with noodle soups anyway.  Maybe I should have gotten a rice dish instead because the couple at the next table seemed to be enjoying their clay pot rice.  Deciding on trying the pork soup dumplings because I have to compare them to every other soup dumpling place.  They were very well made with delicately thin translucent skins and filled with soup.  The soup was a little on the sweet side, but still hearty.  My wife got her Curry Beef Stew Noodle Soup which came out in 2 separate bowls and she mixed them together with zeal.  My Heaven Ramen looked like a bowl of clouds with plenty of seafood in a sea of milky white broth.  Shrimp, fish fillets, bay scallops, sliced fish cakes and a bevy(?) of baby cuttlefish (at least 8 of them) made for a very flavorful, tasty soup bowl.  I'm just glad I didn't get it's evilly spicy, mouth-scorching counterpart, the Devil's Ramen.  I was sweating enough as it is.  Maybe next time, I'll order the Lord of Darkness' forsaken bowl.  But the next time you see me in here will probably be 6 months from now.  I'll be that guy sitting by the window table slurping up steaming, fiery red hot soup and fogging up the windows in zero degree weather.
5 My favorite place for congee! And for wonton mein! And the hot stone rice!  I'll stop here before I list about 7 other items.   The congee here makes me long for Chinatown congee when I'm more than 2 mta stops away from Chinatown.   I've been coming here religiously for the past few years. Have I mentioned that the congee makes me happy? It does.   Staff is kind. Prices are affordable, fun to bring a group in order to try different snacks as well.    Highly recommend for a snack or for a meal!
5 My first experience in this place was fantastic. The food is just superb and I would eat again. Their wonton noodle soup was just delicious; I also highly recommend the soup dumplings.
5 TL;DR: YOU CAN'T GO WRONG. It's cheap. It's flavorful. It's legit. The first time I ate here, I had a stupid smile the entire time (even while chewing) 'cause my taste buds were singing.  SERVICE/SPEED/AMBIENCE: Quick & clean. I usually order takeout 'cause I live around the corner, but the one time I dined in was also a pleasant experience.  FOOD: Everything that I've tried here has been on point & legit (minus XLBs aka soup dumplings). Congees - I've tried both the chicken ginger + scallion and the pumpkin + mustard green. Both were delicious, hearty, and flavorful.  Braised Beef Brisket Lo Mein - standing ovation. The brisket is so tender, it just melts in your mouth. And the lo mein is cooked perfectly al dente, the bite is SO clean. And the clear broth that comes on the side, oh man.. umami af.  Ox tail with curry - bomb, but really heavy on flavor. It was a little too much for me as a stand alone meal, but definitely great as a secondary dish. Also FYI (just in case)- this curry is the XO sauce kind!  Beef chow fun - Pretty tough to mess this one up, and they didn't so we good. The beef is also very tender, better than most places.  XLB - their soup dumplings are HK style. As a shanghainese person, it didn't suit my palette at all. However, I'm not judging this place based on XLB's, I only wanted to mention this just in case to set expectations.  Five stars because the food is one of the best in the area and for the price, service more than meets expectations.
4 This place is amazing. The wait was kinda long but it was definitely worth it.The staff were kind and the food was delicious.  I ordered the beef ball soup and it was perfect. My entire family loved it.
5 I LOVE THIS PLACE! The food is delicious and fast! Everything here is amazing. The congee (ginger chicken) was flavorful and moist, and perfect if you're feeling under the weather. The shrimp wontons, preserved egg dumplings, and pork dumplings with noodles were a huge portion and each part was delicious!!!! My personal favorite was the preserved egg dumplings. A great deal! The you  tiao are also light and crispy, without being too oily (well, as oily as they could be...). But my personal fave was the stone pot rice! Got it with Chinese sausage once and with spare ribs another time. The Chinese sausage is less healthy but ohhhhhh so so so good! The rice is amazing and crispy! Each portion is generous and enough for a meal on its own. So amazing and am salivating just thinking about my next meal there :)
5 I love Noodle Village. They have the best wonton noodle soup in Chinatown. My dad heard about this place through a friend. We usually go a few times a month.  I like the fact they Noodle Village has the fat thick egg noodles for the wonton soup.  But only when you request it when you order. The pan fried dumplings are another favorite item of mine.  The usually come out perfectly crisp.  I highly recommend Noodle Village for anyone who is visiting NYC or  anyone who lives in NYC.
4 We enjoyed all that we ordered! Shrimp noodle wonton soup, Chinese broccoli, sweet and sour wonton, shrimp friend rice and my son ordered chicken lo mein and it was all good! The place is small so it may be a little wait. Overall it was good. To use your yelp discount you must use cash.
5 I'm so happy we found this gem in Chinatown. Great congee, tasty dumplings and super friendly staff. Will definitely go back next time I'm in town.
5 Yes yes yes! I am originally from Hong Kong and will be frequenting this place many times in the unforeseeable future. The 乾炒牛河 was delicious. Best I've had in New York so far. Fried rice wasn't too oily with really fresh shrimp. Soup dumplings were pretty delish too. Will. Come. Again.
5 This is a very popular spot so expect to wait despite lots of seating.  My favorite items on the menu: Pan Fried Seafood Ramen - flavorful and the restaurant does not skimp on the seafood Curry Braised Beef - heavier kind of curry with bold flavor
4 Good Cantonese style noodle soups. I had the homemade fish ball noodle soup while my friend had the shrimp wonton noodle soup. We also shared a Chinese broccoli dish with oyster sauce. The fish ball noodle soup was good, but not the best fish balls I've had (the texture had some hard bits to it, which was displeasing). The soup base was very delicious. I think I preferred the shrimp wonton noodle soup over the fish ball noodle soup. All in all, each of us spent about $11 for a bowl of noodles + shared veggies. Good value for money and definitely authentic! Would definitely come back and try the rice dishes.
4 Not just noodles! Great chinese food for super cheap. Came here with a party of 5, ordered a bunch of things and it was still under $15 a person.  Make sure you get at least a clay pot dish - the crispy rice at the bottom is soo nice.  Servers were very attentive, as soon as a dish was finished, they removed the plate (obviously to make room for more arriving plates). Dropped my chopsticks and a server across the room noticed with his spidey senses and brought me another.  Will definitely come back.
5 A hidden gem in China town. This place has it all from good service to delicious food. Food seemed very authentic. I had the best dimsums ever here. Also their prices are unbeatable, very affordable.
4 The crabmeat xiaolong bao here was fantastic! They came out piping hot, flavorful, soupy, with a thick enough skin to contain the broth but thin enough to not feel carb-overloaded with each bite. We were pleasantly surprised to find such a good xiaolongbao at a restaurant whose staples are Cantonese dishes.   The congee was alright. We got the fish and pork liver congee, and the pork liver is not as good as some of the other congee places in Toronto and Chicago. But we were really wanting congee that day, and it hit the spot.   The wonton noodle soup was really well done here. The filling to the wonton was flavorful with a full shrimp in each one. And the noodles were probably the best wonton noodles I have ever had: really al dente and has a very good bite to it. Definitely order this.
4 First time here. We found out about this place because I was looking for my favorite pork kidney and liver noodle soup.   The pork kidney and liver noodle soup was so good. The soup was flavorful: ginger and scallion. The egg noodles: soft and thin. Not too salty. I forgot to take a picture because I was so excited I can get this here. I dig right into the dish.  The second item we ordered though was quite disappointing. It was the spicy cuttle fish appetizer. Not spicy. Very salty. We couldn't finish he dish.
3 Solid lunch spot.  The place was hopping with customers - many seemed to be from the neighborhood (a good sign) but we were able to get a table for two without a wait.  The menu has a lot to offer.  I ordered the veggie spring rolls (fried to perfection and packed with veggie filling) and shrimp dumpling lo mein.  The dumplings were delicious, the noodles were tasteless but filling, and I liked that it was garnished with Chinese broccoli.  It is served with a dipping broth, but that too lacked flavor so I opted for a savory garlic chili oil paste instead, which is available at all the tables.  My friend had hot and spicy beef ramen, which he enjoyed  though the portion was more than he could finish in one sitting.  I found the service prompt until the very end where our plates were cleared but we were waiting on the check. I'll definitely keep this in my lunch rotation.
3 Service: the service in this place was alright. The woman who served us was a bit confusing; most likely due to not being fluent with English, which is not a surprise in Chinatown, so I didn't mind.   Food: I ordered beef with rice. I liked the taste and the texture of the beef, but I was only given a very small quantity which kind of pissed me off. Like how can you get full from like 5 finger sized pieces of beef? Seriously? I wish they gave me a lot more. Sigh, I could go to another restaurant and get more for the same price.  Place: the place was very clean and spacious. I also liked how it was conveniently right across the arcade which I took my friend afterwards.   Conclusion: Eh, unless I'm feeling really lazy and want to head to the arcade afterwards, I would eat here again. BUT, next time, I'll try out their noodle dishes since it seems clearly to me that rice dishes aren't their forte.
3 Definitely a great spot for affordable and delicious Chinese food. 3.5 stars, but not good enough to round up to 4. First of all, the soup dumplings here are amazing. The dumpling skin is thinner than most traditional soup dumplings, which means less starchy and more powerful meat/"soup" flavors, in my opinion. For those who like the traditional soup dumplings, maybe this isn't for you, but I really enjoyed it (I ordered just the pork dumplings, no crab). I also had some of my sister's Hot Pot Rice with beef which I also enjoyed; crispy, slightly burnt rice in a stone pot? Yum! Just be aware that it takes an additional 20 minutes to prepare. The only issue I had with the quality of the food here was with the ox tail that my dad ordered. The meat was not cooked long enough and was very tough to eat, far from the fall-off-the-bone style ox tail is meant to be prepared.  The lack of stars is due to customer service: -On a Saturday evening, I asked the hostess how long the wait for a table for 4 would be and she said 5-8 minutes. We waited 15-20 minutes. -I had to flag down multiple waiters before I finally got my iced water. -My mom asked for a refill on her tea and we never got it.  -I ordered the "braised beef ramen" and although it says ramen, the Chinese characters on the menu literally translated to "pull noodles". I got my mom to ask the waiter whether it was ramen or pulled noodles, and he said pulled noodles, but I ended up getting ramen?? It was tasty but definitely not what I was expecting. -Workers rushed to collect bowls without even asking if you're done. I don't know if it's because they had a shortage of bowls, but it sure seemed like it.  For my family of four, the bill came out to be roughly $65, and we doggy bagged most of the ox tail (we planned to heat it up a little longer at home so the meat would be less tough). There are definitely cheaper options in Chinatown, but for the quality of the food here, the price is okay.
4 Food is always delicious at this restaurant. Always go after a screening in Chinatown. Only issue is the weak air conditioning in the summer. Enjoy!!
4 Arguably one of the healthier restaurants in Chinatown. Noodle Village first surprised us with their wonderful customer service, something many restaurants in Chinatown lacks. Their menu was extensive and offers many dishes that you can't find elsewhere. With a group of 5, we settled for 2 XLBs, a cilantro black egg dumpling, beef chow fun, hot pot rice and braised beef noodle hot pot. For most of us, eating in Chinatown usually means a large portion of food with so much grease that you can see your reflection.  - Noodle Village surprised us first with their Beef Chow Fun that came out on a small plate looking like the dullest and saddest plate of Beef Chow Fun I've ever seen. Without the grease, the dish also didn't taste like it should. - The XLBs and cilantro black egg dumpling were average; nothing rave worthy. - The hot pot rice was great; you know they actually make the rice in the hot pot when they warn you that it'll take at least 20 minutes to prepare. Also, you get that wonderful crispy burnt rice stuck to your hot pot! Other places just make the rice with a rice cooker and dump it into the hot pot. - The braised beef noodle hot pot was the most outstanding dish of all. The noodles were soft and juicy from absorbing all the braised beef juice and the braised beef still remained tasty. Highly recommend.  That being said, 4/5 of us left the restaurant half full and 1/5 had to get a bowl of pho elsewhere to be ALMOST full. Noodle Village definitely offer a healthier alternative to most Chinese food albeit with a higher price tag.
5 Oh my god. One of the best chinese food in New York! Prices are relatively cheap. I had the xiao long bao and wanton noodles (with soup). Although I came here with high expectations (thanks to my friends raving about it), almost every single one of them was met! I preferred the wantons over the xiao long baos, and personally think there's no need to get the noodles (just the wantons with soup will do). The prawns were really fresh and juicy!
5 This place is awesome! A little more modern and hip than your traditional Chinatown restaurant. they take credit card which is a definite plus. their food is a little more expensive but the food is great and the restaurant is very clean. I always get the curry beef tendon and brisket - it is amazing and the sauce is great. If I am travelling, I usually call ahead and they have my order ready. their clay pot rice is also very good and so is their congee!  10/10 definitely recommend
4 Very good noodles.  I tried their Beef Chow Fun and I really enjoyed it.  The beef was very soft and went very well with the noodles with slight soy sauce and vegetables.  I would love to come again and try other menus!
2 It's like 2.5 stars  The "crab shanghai dumplings" were not like the typical from shanghai restaurant. I'm ok with different, maybe it's more of it's not as good. The flavors did not have that crab taste. It was very soupy. The dough of the dumpling skin was eh.   The seafood lo mein, was also eh. I thought it was going to be crispy noodle, with a soupy seafood topping. nope it was like dry wet noodle, and came with a side of soup. NOT CRISPY noodle :[ the few pieces of fish was good   the side of just choy, was standard.   Maybe I ordered the wrong dishes? I'm not sure if I would go back - would be a risk haha. but the service was good/fast. place had comfortable seating, and solid A/C on this heat wave kind of day.
4 25 cc minimum!   We ordered the XLB, beef brisket with tendon, and curry oxtail. The xlb were excellent, some of the best I've had in NYC. Lots of soup and the collagen was smack your lips creamy! Beef brisket with tendon had a lot more tendon and skin than I was used to but it was still delicious with the braised sauce. The curry oxtail was thick, creamy curry, Cantonese style. The oxtail meat was a bit hard to chew but it came with two large veggies.   Overall, great place to eat xlb and perhaps just beef brisket (no tendon, they have an option to just order beef brisket). The oxtail curry was delicious but the meat was a bit lacking.
2 The host and wait staff are very nice.  I ordered soup dumplings and were not very impressed.  The dumplings fell apart and had more meat than soup.  The flavor was ok but nothing to scream about.  Maybe they offer other items that might be great..........
4 Noodle village is great! Appears to be very authentic and where the locals go. Crowd is primarily Asians in their mid 20s n some slighty older couples, so if they(foodies) are here you know its good. I had their vegetable pan fried noodles and they were excellent. Full of flavor with the greens, sauce and mushrooms which carried the flavor and definitely worth it to return. It definitely fits meat eaters better than veggies as you will get strange looks if you ask for dishes and substitute tofu or have a veggie option. Ramen is good as well although tofu flavor did not give a good taste to the broth.
2 The waitress was really nice but she never came back after taking our order. My beef in my lo mein was fatty (more like fat with a side of beef) and the noodles were wrong but when I asked another waiter for a side of noodles, he said "no refunds".. I wasn't even asking for a refund. The waiters seated, served other tables around us and they received better and faster service. We requested the 5% Yelp discount and after it was applied, we were asked to pay by cash.. ummmmm, no. The best part of the meal was the fried veggie dumplings and that's why they get 2 stars.
5 I am a XiaoLongBao-Soup Dumplings Connoisseur. This place is either first or second on my list in the NYC Manhattan area. It's a hard competition with Shanghai Manor on 21 Mott St.  Skin - Thee best skin I've had when it comes to XLB. Soup - Above Pat but doesn't take the cake when it comes to S. Manor. Meat - On equal with the bests in the area. This place has the best clippers I've seen. It doesn't break the bun when you grab it.  There are so many Soup Dumplings or XLB in the area. I'll update as I experience more.
5 So this was my lunch destination after walking the Brooklyn Bridge from Brooklyn to Manhattan. From the outside it looked like just another place. I found the inside to be a warm inviting mix of classic Chinese wood and some modern tones in the wall coverings.  We started with some very nice dumplings and tasty vegetable spring roll.   My wife got the Hong Kong Lo mean with flank steak and beef tendon. She said it was delicious, I has a taste and it was great.  My daughter had Hong Kong Lo men with beef liver and green onion. She loved it. I chose the Hong Kong Lo mein with spicy pork sauce. I really liked it but was not as spicy as I would have preferred.  Service was excellent and the wait staff was very attentive.
4 Mmmm. Love me some crab pork soup dumplings served by an appropriately crabby waitress while staring down two strangers at the same table. This is no-frills, cheap Chinatown eating at its best (though I make no bones about my productivity level after lunch). At a weekday lunchtime, there was no line.   Came here without getting the famed noodles or wontons. Did get three orders of dumplings and one enormous bowl of congee with century egg and pork. Out of the dumplings, I liked the steamed veggie ones the best, chock full of vermicelli, shredded carrots, and chestnut. The crab pork dumplings tasted pretty standard among all the Chinatown soup dumpling places - that is to say, sufficiently tasty and satisfying but nothing otherworldly. My favorite is still the ones from the Joe's Shanghai in Flushing.   The congee was excellent, though. The chunks of pork and century egg were quite abundant. I always overestimate how much congee I am physically capable of eating in one sitting, as it's still watered down rice, but even half the bowl kept me nice and full until dinner.   Very, very affordable: three orders of dumplings + one bowl of congee + one plate of green leafy vegetables with oyster sauce was $40, including tip.
5 Great place! Came here with my date late night. Realized all our other spots were closed, so I dragged us here haha. Glad I did! We were both craving soup dumplings and got two orders of different soup dumplings off the menu. Split an order of beef fried rice because we saw the photos of plates and it looked huge. Glad we split it because we could barely finish. Dinner for two with tip came out to $30 which was amazing. Be aware, they only accept card when your total is over $25. Great for a late night, and kind service!
5 Wow, what an amazing experience. We couldn't get into Joe's and came here. Will be coming straight here from now on.
4 Good food for reasonable prices. A friend and I were trying to decide on a restaurant in Chinatown for dinner. I was in the mood for dim sum and she was craving noodle soup, so naturally, we decided on Noodle Village.  We split a plate of the Chinese broccoli, and it was okay - a little tough, but with a delicious sauce on the side. We also got two orders of the XLB (pork and crab). I prefer the pork, but both were very tasty. I also ordered a bowl of shrimp dumpling noodle soup which was decent - a little watery, but the dumplings were hearty. My friend had similar thoughts on her beef noodle soup. Our bill came out to be around $34 - not bad at all. The 5% discount from Yelp check-ins is only applicable from Monday through Thursday, however.  We came at around 8PM on a Friday night and there were plenty of tables available. Service was friendly and more attentive than your average Chinatown establishment.
5 Excellent food quality.  Price is on the higher than average side by Chinatown standard.  Services is good.  They have much more than Noodle dishes so don't let the name fool you.
5 I literally wanted to eat everything here. So many choices and great prices!   My friend and I got noodles and crab XLB (soup dumplings) and the total was $26! Each of our noodles came with a side of broth which was clean and perfect to wash down the noodles and their XLB were nice too - thin wrapper with just the right amount of broth inside.  Service was quick and attentive and I loved that the food wasn't super oily. Their congee looked great - it's a perfect place to get a bunch a dishes and share family style.   Will be back for sure!
5 Noodle is good! Will be there again! Waited for 10 mins to get the seats. The service is nice!
4 There was a massive craving for noodles of all sorts and of course Yelp saved the day with this gem. We popped into Noodle Village for our first stop in NYC.  It was a pretty quiet weekday afternoon when we walked in, but was soon filled with patrons. Props must be given to the cleanliness of the restaurant, it should really be a given, but y'all have to know that Chinese restaurants usually ain't this squeaky clean!  With it's vast offerings, I skimmed through the menu while the gf hastily scrolled through Yelp pictures looking for the best dishes. We decided to go with the pork xiao long bao (XLB), pan-fried seafood ramen, and steamed rice roll with soy & peanut sauce.   Pork XLB ($5.75) was delicious, the skin is very thin, shiny, and translucent. The soup was fairly light and hearty. It's one of the best XLB I've had in the New England area.  Pan-fried seafood ramen ($12.95) was something on the menu that I've never seen before and gave it a shot. It had a variety of seafood: squid, fish cake, shrimp, imitation crab meat, scallop, fish ball. The dish tasted somewhat heavy with the infused sauce, but it was also quite good.  Steamed rice roll with soy, Sriracha, and peanut sauce ($4.50) gave my gf fond memories of her childhood. It's a street food staple in Hong Kong and we have not seen it anywhere in Boston. I thought it was ok, it's nothing spectacular - it's simply rice roll with a different sauce that I did not care for. Not to take anything away from Noodle Village, it was prepped perfectly, it was simply street food that is better eaten on the go, imo.
5 Noodle Village is such a great spot in Chinatown, whether you're looking for lots of small dishes to share with a group of people or just want a nice bowl of noodles to yourself. My personal favorite on the menu is the beef brisket noodle soup, number 81 I think, with the cilantro and black egg dumplings as a close second. The spicy cuttlefish is also killer, as well as the spicy fried tofu.  Finally, if you get any of those dishes you also gotta get a side of at least 1-2 orders of pork xiao long bao!! Each order has six perfect little lumps of soupy fatty pork wrapped in a thin dumpling skin. Be warned: these are addictive and will make you want to come back every week!  For it's super reasonable prices and flavor-filled dishes, Noodle Village is slowly becoming one of my favorite places in NY. You definitely won't regret coming here!
2 Not the best food but not the worst but I'd say closer to the latter.... they are efficient in bringing out food, just random in delivery. My beef fried rice came out first... then our dumplings like 10 min after that then my husbands meal 15 min after that. My beef fried rice was pretty bland and lacked meat, there was a few pieces but not much. My husband ordered a dish of which he thought had all different kinds of meat in it, but what he got was a weird flavorless pork hot pot... oddly enough the broccoli in it was good.  They were efficient at removing dishes and pleasant enough. The crab steam dumplings weren't great but the weird pickled brown sauce was absolutely putrid.  Perhaps we were there on an off day, but I wouldn't go running back.
5 Walking though Chinatown for the first time I knew I had to try a local spot. After deciding between a few places something about this no frills eatery drew me to it. I'm glad I came here. This place was perfect!   My first sign that we found the right place was the crowd. The place was busy and full of locals. Always a good sign.   Everything I read said to try the soup dumplings. I ordered the shrimp ones and they were amazing. The shrimp tasted very fresh and the dumplings were cooked to perfection.   I also tried the wonton noodles with shrimp. They were excellent as well. My friend had the congee. It was not what he thought it was going to be at all but that proved to be a good thing. It was a delicious porridge and he couldn't inhale it fast enough.   The price was a bargain too. I've already recommended this place a few times and I just came here recently. I'll definitely be coming back.
4 Truth time: I only came here because I was sloshed from Apotheke (in a CLASSY way, thank you very much), wanted food at late hours, and this place was open, cheap and HAD NOODLES IN SOUP!  So at ?:?? AM, I found myself here with some friends slurping Beef Brisket Noodle Soup and Pork Soup Dumplings. Maybe it was the kale and daisy martinis I had at Apotheke, but these dishes were deeeeelicious. I felt like the boss wife of some Hong Kong triad king slumming it in one of the city's dark corners.
5 My coworker organized a delivery order - we are in Fidi and there's a dearth of good Chinese down here.   - Black egg/pork congee - delicious, comes in a big tub. - Wonton Lo-Mien. I got it without soup but still got a tub of soup to go with. Both were perfect.  - Steam rice roll with sesame and hoisin sauce. Delicious - this is literally a roll with nothing inside.   My coworker also got fried fish skin which was surprisingly very good and goes perfectly with congee. I think delivery took a while around lunch, and our building is a pain to find so I felt bad for delivery guy. Works out well if we have a big order to tip more.
5 This place is forever. Its the best poverty restaurant in NYC. Every time i break up with a boo or I get some serious shit at work I come here to mend my heart. The first time I came here, I thought it would be terrible because the service is too good for a "legit Chinese joint" but little did I know that sometimes you can get the cake and eat it too (every time). The xiaolongbao are light and sweet, perfect skin texture. My usual, wonton w egg noodle with beef brisket is def (one of) the items on my Last Supper list. Y'all going to Joes Shanghai for the dumplings and noodletown for the noodles are messing up royally. 13 Mott St is the GOAT. Xoxo forever
2 The food was fine (wonton mein), but not enough to overshadow the crappy experience I had when paying the bill. The lady who closed the bill for us blatantly asked for more tips; it felt pretty rude and I left pretty upset...
3 Food was good. We ordered the juicy buns and was juicy and tasty.  The skin was so thin.   We orders the 3 is a kind Dumplings HK Lo mein. Was tasty and dumplings were yummy. Service was not that great. Felt I was  rushed to get the check.   Staffs were too proactive in getting the customers out the restaurant.
2 For a place with "noodles" in their title you would think the noodles would be the main attraction. Unfortunately, the noodles were not that impressive. I ordered two types. I ordered HK style lomein (just egg noodles without the broth) and rice roll noodles with the sesame soy mixture. The lomein was flavorless. I also tried the broth on the side which did not taste right. The sauce for the rice rolls were a bit on the sour side which is unusual from the ones I usually have. Two stars for service. Would not come back.
4 I find it quite difficult to find healthy food options in Chinatown. We ended up here since they have a large menu selection. We got steamed Chinese Broccoli, wonton soup, and dumplings soup. They're known for their wontons here, but I like the dumplings over the wonton. The mushrooms bits in the dumplings gives it so much more flavor, and with a little bit of their homemade spicy oil, you just can't get enough of it. Only thing I didn't like was the soup, super salty. I like my wonton/ dumpling soup clean and light, way too much salt in it. Big wong is still my favorite wonton spot. Overall, I think I'll definitely come back next time and try the noodle dishes which I saw a lot of people get.
3 I was looking for authentic Chinese food, not the typical American stuff that has probably become a long standing inside joke among Chinese immigrants about how we have to eat General Tso Chicken religiously with fried noodles, egg roll, and wonton soup. I wanted to see if those things are really even on a menu among locals.   They are not. I had what I guess was the equivalent of wonton soup, minus wontons. It was very fishy, which when looking up recipes is apparently supposed to be made with dried fish powder or something like that. They brought a cup of tea and no fried noodles and didn't have egg rolls or the usual items on the menu. These are not complaints, I was actually learning my hypothesis was correct which was what I set out to do. I got brisket lo mein, which I usually don't eat but it was the only typical Americanized Chinese food for which I could do a comparison. I actually thought it was quite underseasoned. The noodles had their own taste, not from a sauce. The brisket was very good.What was there of a sauce was microscopic to where I couldn't even taste it. The price without a drink or anything else was under $10.   I would have liked to have gotten congee and dumplings because it seems that most of the locals were eating it.
5 Why have you only entered my life now? Best wonton noodles this side of the world! Springy and perfectly 'al dente' egg noodles.  They serve really delicious varieties of congee and soup noodles.  So happy that someone finally decided to combine simple Cantonese classic congee and soup noodles with shanghai xiao long bao.  Usually I would have to pick one or the other when I'm out at Chinatown but it's all here! The menu is extensive yet simple.  Perfectly thin-skinned delicious xiao long bao, cruellers for your congee, steamed shrimp rolls with peanut and hoisin sauce! All delish! Prices are slightly higher than the rest of Chinatown. Everything is probably $1 more but I prefer that for high quality.  I almost didn't want to post this review on Yelp because I really don't want to fight to get a table!
5 I was alone - jury duty lunch break - and so I didn't have to wait at all - they sat me at a large table with three gentlemen discussing some travel company business. Their food looked absolutely delicious, by the way.  My pig liver and kidney lo mein was outstanding. The liver was tender, no overcooking, the noodles springy and dense.
5 My recommendations:  Soup dumplings Pan fried seafood noodles Chicken and ginger congee Beef brisket ramen   Fast and good service. Eat till you are all bao (full). :)
5 The most insane noodle soup and dumplings u can get in chinatown, manhattan. The chinese clay pot rice is delicious. The most insane and legit dish they have to offer is the dumplings. The soup dumplings taste like one bite into the dumpling and u want to eat more of it. The must try item that I would suggest is the braised brisket noodle soup. The broth is just insane legit. Come here if u want a truly amazing experience for dumplings. I crave their dumplings every time I come to chinatown. Space is quite small. U will love the food when u come once. You'll be craving or looking to come back.
5 Perfect place for some Chinese style breakfast (or brunch)!   They have a wide selection of noodles (both dry and in soup), rice, and congee options, basically every combination of ingredients you can think of; this allows you to order based on what you want, whether it be noodles with soup, without soup, with tendons, with wontons, etc.   There's usually a wait since this place is really popular, but it passes pretty fast.
4 I am impressed. Enjoyed the food, service was wonderful, atmosphere is pleasant. The place is packed and we haven't had to wait for anything. We had shrimp lo mein, soup, pork dumplings and shives, peach punch, tea. Everything was good, and we had fun in the process. No complaints. Definitely coming here again!
5 Very typical cantonese restaurant in chinatown. I had the pork feet and beef stew with ramen. Those are definitely one of the best i had in years. The waitors/waitreses here are friendly and they gave you good suggestions on food choices too, if you speak cantonese. The food was ready fast too.
5 This is the most authentic Chinese (Hong Kong) restaurant. It is usually crowded. The food is very good, especially the congee. You can also get good Hong Kong style milk tea which is surprisingly impossible to get one in any bakery in China Town.
5 Amazing! Best ramen I've had.   The devilish ramen is a must try. Next time I will have to try the wonton noodles. It also looked delish.  You will leave the restaurant as bloated as can be, but hey, what do you expect from ramen?!
5 Great service for a Chinese restaurant!  Meals come with fresh hot tea (perfect for this cold weather) was constantly being refilled.  The workers seem to want u to come back unlike great ny noodletown which has good food but lousy service.  We shared the Chinese brunch clay pot w/Chinese sausage and spare ribs & a bowl of wonton noodle soup. The hot pot was excellent and reminded me of my childhood eating this dish growing up & looking forward to it on Sunday mornings.  The wonton noodle soup is one of the better ones in the city.
5 Whenever I'm craving non-greasy Hong Kong style Chinese food, I usually come here.   My favorite thing is the "bo jai fan" or the sizzling rice pot with various meats: salted duck, Chinese sausage, etc...ADD the extra salted egg to make it authentic! DO NOT forget to add the soy sauce that's already on the table and mix well! The table next to us followed my lead so apparently some people don't know to do that.   The wonton noodles are one of a kind, they are springy with great flavor. Sources tell me that the noodles are imported from Canada (shhhh). Definitely get the wonton noodle soup, it's satisfying and you won't feel too heavy afterwards.   Also great are the congees (rice soup), steamed noodles with sesame and peanut sauce, steamed soup dumplings, rice dishes....LOL the whole menu basically.   Oh just come here, it's good eats.
1 I'm very unsatisfied with the meal. I placed one order for takeout and waited over thirty minutes for it to even appear. Every time I asked the hostess for information, I was told it was coming but the wait kept getting longer and longer. Five customers, who came in after I had already placed my order, were served and left before I did. Some of those customers ordered five items and were serviced quicker than my one item.  I definitely won't be returning to this establishment anytime soon. I'm highly disappointed.
4 One of the cleanest chinese places I've been to in Chinatown.  I ordered the rice pot with sausage and chinese sausages. It was large enough to feed me for two more days of lunch.  I love how I can pour in my own soy sauce because sometimes it's not enough.
4 Amazing noodles and tea! I Highly recommend this very clean restaurant in chinatown. Portions are plentiful and staff is very nice and thoughtful.
5 Overall rating: Such good shrimp wontons!!!! I really liked the shrimp wonton noodles. Quick and great, I would definitely go back again!  Food: My boyfriend and I each had a bowl of shrimp wonton noodles and shared an order of xiao long bao (soup dumplings). The wontons were SO 香. There's no other way to describe it. They were very similar to how my mom makes them, which is definitely a compliment. I also really liked the noodles and soup, it wasn't salty, but it was still very flavorful and aromatic. The soup dumplings were alright. The flavors were good, but the meat was loose and basically mixed it with the soup. If you want good soup dumplings that have that "bitey" feeling, go to Joe's Shanghai.   Cost: The total for 2 bowls of noodles (one large and one regular) and dumplings was about $20. Definitely a great price for the amount of food and quality we got.   Atmosphere/Appearance: The space was crowded, but, luckily, we got a seat immediately. The space was kind of small (but clean!) so it's very likely that you'll end up sharing a table with another party, but that wasn't a big deal for me. The atmosphere was cozy and casual.   Service: The staff was on top of everything and efficient. It definitely helps if you can speak Cantonese or Mandarin, but I'm sure you'll be ok if you didn't (like our neighbors).
2 Horrible service in general. When we walked in the woman did not even bother to look at me when I asked her whether there's a table for two. Apparently, she ignores people who don't speak Cantonese.  After we sat down, she came to us again and told us to move because the tables were so tight that I moved it to the right to separate us from the left table. I thought she was worried that I couldn't get out, and I said it wasn't a problem to her. She then replied: " It's not about you! It's about the people who are going to sit here later! " I'm like: " I don't care. U can move the table later." Then it's after that she left.  I can't believe they took this awful Hong Kong service attitude here. Who do they think they are?
5 Simply put, this is my shameless-eat restaurant.  Me and my boyfriend ordered: 1. Soup Dumpling Soup dumpling was excellent, the first sip of the soup will give you warmth and comfort to face the rest of your day. 2. Shiu May - good 3. Har Gau - good 4. Black Egg w/ Pork Congee They have a really good congee here and size is definitely for share. 5. Shrimp Wonton Lo Mein I've tried a lot of their noodle dish and in average they taste great.  So when we had all 5 menu for 2 on our table, a couple that sit next to us literally shared one dish, something with veggie, and rice. I mean, hey, who are we to say who's normal and who's not?!  Oh and here's a few tips: 1. When you think "should I order this or that?", order both.  2. Eat it while its hot. I understand as social beings, we feel the urge to communicate with others. But dim sum food does not wait. 3. If you don't know how to eat soup dumpling delicately: put it on your spoon, poke it or make a small hole, sip the soup, eat the rest. 4. Chili oil is right there, its dim sum's bestfriend, they complete each other.
4 The Xiao Long Bao here are one of the best I've tried in NYC. The only downside, is that the skin of the XLBs can be a little thin sometimes though, and can break really easily if you're not careful. The porridge they service is good as well, but not a huge fan on the fried dough fritters. I've tried the wanton soup, and didn't think it was particularly great, I would definitely still recommend the place though :)
4 Portions are a bit smaller than I expected. Friendly workers. It's a simple Chinese place and they serve more than just noodles: congee, soup dumplings, and special drinks. I would have gave it 5 stars if the portions were a bit bigger.
5 Super cute place on Motts street..the owner was very nice and sat us even before the rest of my party arrived.   The food was reasonably priced and delicious. Order the mei fun and shrimp rolls!!
4 Loved the Noodle Village in Chinatown! My husband and I were seated at a table when we arrived, but shortly after there was a wait. They do seat you at a table that's family style, so get ready to meet and become friends with strangers. Upon seating they serve you hot green tea. If you want water you must ask.   The dumplings were hands down the best dumplings I've ever had and mixing them with the red pepper sauce at the table gave them a real kick. For my meal I got the 'shrimp wonton, shrimp dumpling cilantro with black egg dumplings Lo Mein ($8.25)'. This was equally as good as the appetizer. It also came with some bok choy that gave the dish some texture. Great flavors..  Prices are great too ($7-$10 per meal), but they only accept credit cards over $25...Cant beat that in the city!  My meal was great and if I still lived in NYC I would come back here again, but there are so many places to try for me to return when visiting...    PS: After you meal is over head to 10 below across the street for a real treat!!!
3 The soup was bland and noodles plain. The shrimp dumplings are good but fish cakes not so much
4 Wow the food here is AWESOME! I haven't said that about many Chinese places in New York, as I have very high standards. I came on a weekday night and before I ordered, I asked if it's cash only. One of the waiters said minimum $25, to which I said I have no cash. He said it's okay, just sit and eat. So I did. I ordered a wonton noodle soup with flat rice noodles, and it took a while to come out (I took this as a good sign because that means they're actually cooking my food, not giving me some pre-made food). Needless to say, when my food came out, it was piping hot! The soup was very flavorful, and the flat rice noodles weren't too soggy - it was perfectly chewy. The wontons were delicious as well; dipped in the red chili oil provided, they were even better! The shrimp inside was fresh, and the wonton was very flavorful and held together well. The entire meal was delicious. One thing that was lacking was some sort of green vegetable! When time came to pay the bill, I of course gave my credit card, and I (foresaw this coming) was told that they accept credit card with minimum $25. I told her I only had cash and that I had told the waiter from before I ate that I have no cash on me and he said I could eat, but she left and then another waitress came by and I told her the same thing, and she took the bill and my credit card. The waiter from before gave me the receipt and my card, and he also told me to remember that for next time, remember that minimum for credit card is $25.  If not for the whole credit card business, I would've given this place 5 stars for the food. Good price (around $6.50 post-tax pre-tip) for the bowl of noodles and four wontons for good quality. Definitely recommend, but remember to bring cash or spend more than $25.
4 Noodle Village satisfied my craving for wonton noodles.   I'm usually a big fan of the jumbo wontons made of ground shrimp, but Noodle Village's wontons are impressive as well -- not super large, but at least there are actual pieces are shrimp inside. The egg noodles were pretty standard.   I'm getting the feeling that most Chinatown restaurants just love the throw soup dumplings on their menu. Fine, I tried it at Noodle Village as well -- pretty decent. The skin is just right, the meat is good, but the soup is way too salty. The scallion pancakes, however, were pretty bomb.   Overall, I was pleasantly surprised, and will be coming back...
1 I showed up at 9PM on a Wednesday and was told very rudely that I couldn't order half of the items on the menu because it was 'too late'.  I was then yelled at for not leaving a large enough tip.....will NEVER frequent this place again... go next door to hop kee or wo hop.
5 Have no complaint at all! Language barrier was a bit difficult but we managed. They give you complimentary black tea and I order the chefs special #2 fried seafood ramen. It was relish! I recommend adding a bit of soy sauce and that's about it. Perfection ! I also ordered shrimp and beef dumplings which was good As well.
4 Soup dumplings are off the hook!!!  The skin is super thin, the thinnest I think I've ever eaten in a soup dumpling - almost clear! The soup is flavorful and not too dense with the pork fat. Dumplings are plump with tender ground meat! So satisfying!  We also got the noodles with spicy pork sauce - as was recommended by fellow yelpers. Not too impressed. Noodles were a bit too al dente for Chinese style noodles and the flavor of the sauce was flat. I only tasted soy sauce. Would not recommend.  Service was meh. Asked for a bowl (in Mandarin) and the guy pointed to my plate saying I had one. Then he brought me one after I again insisted on having a bowl. Later another server started clearing the table while I was still sitting drinking tea. You know that feeling you have when you're a customer but from the way the servers are treating you, you feel like you owe them something? That's how it was here so...-1 star for the service   Would come back only for soup dumplings and maybe to try another variety of noodles. There is an extensive selection so I'm sure this place has more to offer!
5 This is a eatery with a clear focus on congee and noodle as their Chinese store name indicates.The congee here is great not only for the flavorful broth but also the rice. Rice is a important ingredient yet rarely do Chinese resturants pay attention to. The Chinese doughnut (油條) is a must and go so well with congee and/or dishes rich in flavor like the curry beef ox tail. The HK milk tea is the best I've found in China town so if you like HK style milk tea don't miss this treasure. I've tried many other items and they're all good so it depends on what you want to eat on that day. You can't go wrong with the dishes under 'Chef Specialites'.
1 Really bad altitude on delivery!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This situation shown up several times. Even when I pay enough amount of tip Never order again
1 The service attitude is so bad！ The first time I order， the order person yelloed at me and shouted. This time the delievery person shouted me through phone！ I order for this service and pay it，why you guys cannot treat your customers with better attitude？！
4 The soup dumplings here are pretty legit.  I came in with two friends on a Friday night at around 7 when we wanted a tasteful meal, but we were all on a budget. That's when one of them suggested soup dumplings at Noodle Village. I haven't had many authentic soup dumplings. They usually come from a plastic bag from the freezer section of a Chinese supermarket. Plus, Noodle Village was on my bookmarks list so I was definitely down to try this place out.  The place was pretty full but luckily, we didn't have to wait for a table. The food takes a bit longer to come out than most Chinese restaurants, but it's worth the wait. We ordered the pork soup dumpling and the crab meat soup dumplings and each came with 6 pieces. They came out piping hot. The broth in the dumplings was flavorful, but didn't seem too fatty (like Joe's Shanghai).  We also ordered a clay pot rice dish and the beef with ginger and scallion lo mein. The rice was great - it had that perfect crust at the edges. I wasn't huge fan of the lo mein because it was made with egg noodles, which I'm not a huge fan of. However, the ginger and scallion gave it a really great flavor. Add some of their house hot sauce and it actually make those noodles more tolerable.  One of my friends I was with said that she loves the wonton noodle soup here, so I'll definitely be back to give that a try and to order some more soup dumplings.
3 The food was good but I wouldn't wait to eat here. The soup dumplings were better than average but not amazing. The rice clay pot was not very good and not special compared to other Cantonese restaurants. We also ordered the wonton noodle soup which was ok. As a visitor with a limited number of meals in the city, I would not choose to eat here.
5 This place is insanely underrated. Food is very high quality and the restaurant itself is very clean. This is a rare exception in Chinatown, because not only is it clean and welcoming, they also pride themselves on not using msg.  Cheap, delicious, and clean.  I highly recommend the stone pot rice, pork soup dumplings, and the beef brisket noodles.
4 I can't gauge authenticity, but the food is delicious.   Good enough for me. It's not soupy, saucy, breaded-fried corner takeout, which does have its place.  2 on a Friday, 9p. fall A long wait. 2 on a weekday, 8p. winter no wait, but full.  dumplings in chili oil - tasty pork buns - good but not great, compare poorly to other iterations of this dish  cumin lamb - hot, but easily moderated if you don't eat all the peppers, tender, mild lamb, wish it were a little funkier. dry fry pork - delicious, lots of heat. double cooked pork belly - leeks are delicious in this, great flavor, pork was a little chewy do to technique, may try chicken next time. crispy rice chicken - tasty but very mild and a little boring compared to other things.  Food It's all delicious, looking forward to trying the rest of it.  I think the best thing it's done has been to strip down and explain an otherwise opaque set of dishes.  It's could be a bit reductive but you still get very tasty food from the deal.  Service Can be uneven, but I don't expect much for this pricepoint and environment.  Atmosphere Boisterous, crowded, but not too tightly packed.  The first time I went, I remembered it as hideous.  Second trip, it was just fine.  Had the same table.  Maybe the light was lower.  Totally passable, better than functional decor, but not too gaudy.  I came back strictly for the food.
1 The food is good, but the customer service is unbelievably bad. It's almost a joke. I've never encountered anything like it. I recommend never ordering take out (over the phone) or delivery from here.
4 Great Chinese food! Might be the best Chinese restaurant in the city. It's a small place, so it's usually packed. They don't take reservations but it's worth the wait.
5 Came here on a Tuesday around 6PM and got seated immediately. The restaurant started filling up throughout our meal.   Must haves: Cucumbers and Dan Dan Noodles  We also ordered the hot sauce style chicken (I enjoy spicy food and thought we could've gone spicier even though it was a level 7) and Mapo Tofu.  The cucumbers had a layer of sweetness unlike other types I've had - it was a nice freshness to balance out the heartiness of the rest of the dishes.   I couldn't stop smiling after my first bite of the Dan Dan Noodles. I'm coming back just for that.
5 I love this place.  I'm from Philly and use to go to the one in Manayunk.  Nice to see there is one in the East Village.  All of their dishes are packed with flavor.  I recommend the kung pao chicken.  Also the dan dan noodles are the bomb.  I will continue to come back here for years to come!
4 After frequenting their Manayunk location for years back when I lived in Philly, I was surprised to see they had spots in NYC as well. I knew I had to give one of them a try. We stopped in on a Monday around 3ish and didn't have to wait for a table.   Their scallion pancakes are always a solid choice. Although they were a bit on the oily side, they're chewy and flaky. Everything a scallion pancake should be. My braised beef noodle soup was a gift from the gods on that bitter cold day. The bowl was huge and filled to the brim with tender beef, noodles, and veggies.   The clear winner was the Kung Pao Chicken. Talk about downright addictive. I couldn't help but sneak another piece when my partner wasn't looking.   Han Dynasty continues to deliver top notch food and service.
2 Food is good but they can't cook fast enough to make deliveries. I ordered my food through Caviar at 11:30 AM, that's when they open the doors for lunch. It's 1 PM and they are STILL cooking my cabbage!  This is a major fail.
5 Everything is great here if you like vy spicy Szechuan food. Must have the Dan Dan noodles!
5 I went on a Wednesday night, and arrived around 6:30.. I had to wait a few minutes for my friend, and we were seated right away.  Upon sitting down we were served tea, which they provide to everyone at no cost, which is a lovely touch. We started with dumplings in chili oil, which were just divine..perfectly cooked and just spicy enough (but not too spicy!). For our entrees, we shared Garlic Sauce Style Chicken, and increased the heat level to 4. The chicken was perfectly seasoned and just spicy enough. We also selected Pea Leaves with Garlic, which were perfectly cooked, and refreshing on a cold January day. I can't wait to go back.
2 Ordered delivery. I ordered three things they all tasted like burnt grease. Probably won't order from here again.
5 Absolutely delicious. This is so far my favorite Chinese in the city. I had the Kung Pao chicken and it was heaven. I love that they have lamb option for their dishes, which I don't see a lot. Great food, highly recommended.
3 Amazing food. Worst service ever. We were seated on a dirty table, that's fine. We cleaned it. We were never given menus. That's fine - we grabbed our own. Server took forever to come... that's ok, we waited. Finally as we were trying to order he was flying away - wouldn't stay long enough to hear everything. The tiny restaurant wasn't even busy, maybe half full at best.  That being said the food was phenomenal, do not regret going there but I do wish their service was better.
4 Authentic Chinese food.. I ordered dan dan noodles and cumin style chicken.. which was pretty authentic and taste was nice.
3 Great food, terrible services!  They "forgot" one of our orders, started cleaning the table even before we finished the food, and charged 20% gratitude automatically on our bill.
5 I'm not ashamed to admit that I've eaten Han twice in two days before. I am completely addicted to their Dry Pepper Tofu. The tofu is cooked to crispy perfection and the dish is at the perfect spice level. I've also tried their Cumin Chicken and their Pea Leaves with Garlic before, both of which were amazing. The Eggplant with Garlic Sauce was decent, but much more mild when compared to the other dishes. If I could eat Han every day, I would! The wait is usually pretty long, but worth it.
5 The Dan Dan noodles here are great! The UWS location, not so much. They use different noodles uptown as well as a different recipe.
4 Came here because I saw the episode on Munchies with the owner, who's hilarious af.   The wait can be long but the food is pretty good. It's definitely somewhat Americanized but authentic enough to please.
5 I stop in here once in a while when I'm in the area and I have to say the food is really good. Lots of flavor! Definitely a good purchase for the price, highly recommended to anyone who likes Chinese food!
5 I think this might be the first time trying Szechuan food and it was delicious. Came with a group of friends so we decided to eat family style to try a variety of food. Got the dan dan noodles, kung pao chicken, baby bok Choy with mushrooms and wontons in chili oil. Everything was delicious and had nothing to complain about, bit greasy but it's expected for food like this (and not too greasy to the point where it was unappetizing) that's why we got be bok Choy to balance it out. They also serve hot tea which counteracts the greasiness. Would definitely recommend and would def come back for more!
2 ok dan dan noods. very greasy spring rolls. over all very greasy food for my taste. also the oil is heavy and indigestible. my first and last.......and 1 hour later...triple diarrhea
1 Terrible service. Essentially they don't care if you're there or not. On a recent visit we had to get our own menus and water refill from the bar. Ignored for about 20 min once at our table and made to feel like the waiter was doing us a favor by taking our order. We should have left but weather outside was bad and we were being lazy. Food was good but nothing special and definitely not worth the bad service. Food would be a solid 3 stars but given over all experience I can only give them 1.
5 The food is so good and so reasonably priced here. The service is good also. The Dan Dan Noodles are addictively good. Do not pass on them. And the spice level numbers are accurate and most dishes you can ask for a lower spice level, if need be, and it'll be more mild.
5 Dined in here twice and left both times super satisfied.  The first time was a reservation so we got seated promptly, the second time was a walk in and was about an 1.5 hour wait which turned into 1 hour wait.  Everything I or anyone who I was with tried here was really good (dry pepper style, garlic sauce style, kung pao style, chicken, tofu, and beef).  Also get the dan dan noodles to start.  They have a pretty decent drink selection as well.
3 The food is OK but the service is just so so. I think there are many great Chinese restaurant to choose and I think this one tastes better.
4 Also recommend - Three pepper chicken !
5 I like what they are trying to make real Chinese food and also consider the taste of local customers.   I came here twice. The menu changed quite a bit. But everything they provide are good.  Recommend
5 What a great find. Everything delicious. I will ad pictures shortly. You must eat here if yopu are in the area.
5 When I lived on 13th Street between 2nd and 3rd a corny looking Chinese Restaurant opened on 3rd avenue..just a stone's throw away. It was HAN DYNASTY, the sign in humongous red neon letters, the decor typical.   Little did I know how that it would become one of our favorite places on the Earth!   This outfit outta Philly came with heavy foodie cred, and my pal Shawn clued us in early on, and once we went we were hooked. We nicknamed it Handy Nasty, sometimes The Handy Nasty.   Szechuan Chinese Food is characterized by spice, the majority of the dishes are en fuego, and when you are in the East Village, Han Dynasty is the only place to go.  Dan Dan Noodle  Dumplings in spicy chili oil  The dry fire rub crispy pork or lamb you can't go wrong  The fish that numbs your mouth with the crazy WU pepper is bananas.   Aunt June runs the joint she is the coolest, very personable lady.  Get the dishes I recommended, get a vegetable, and have a great time!
4 The beef noodles and spicy dumplings are the best in NYC.
1 I have eaten here multiple times and their food is average Szechuan fare. Their customer service however is crap. Every time I have come here, there is always something odd and slow about their customer service.  The main reason I come is convenience to work, and this time I decided on takeout. 45 minutes later and after asking twice (being told each time it was coming), I found out that they had in fact lost my order. I personally prefer non-chains anyways, and this finally sealed the deal. There is simply better Chinese food with better customer service.
3 A bit disappointed and sad that Han Dynasty didn't live up to all the hype in NY. I happen to be in Philadelphia and wanted to grab dinner before heading back to NY. The place restaurant was empty and the service was lacking. Staff was not attentive and oddly huddled together, while patrons were just sitting at their tables. The food was disappointing too. We ordered dan dan noodles, which are simple and standard fare, so these were okay. But the tea smoked duck was mostly bits and pieces of jagged cut duck, and almost all bone and no meat. There were probably a couple of morsels and then the rest of the pot was veggies. We also ordered the chili tofu and fish... way way way too much oil. It was drowning in it and didn't have enough of the ma lat, numbing pepper, taste. I wish it was better but you'd have better luck at non-mainstream szechuan restaurants. Luckily, there are plenty back in NYC.
1 The food was delicious, but most of the servers and hosts are rude. During our lunch, a group of 4 came in and one of the patrons walks ahead thinking he can seat himself. A simple mistake, however the host rudely stops him and says "You just can't walk in here."  Also, I got up to use the restroom and the head host stops me and says "Excuse me, do you work here?" Not sure of it was racial profiling, but I've never been in a restaurant where I'm stopped and asked if I'm an employee after being there for over an hour.
3 First, the food:  overall, excellent. Second, the service:  Horrible!!  The waiter took our order promptly & my entree came out fairly quickly.  The 2nd person in our party waited another 5 minutes for his dish to be served & the 3rd person waited at lease 15 more minutes!!  No apology, no nothin'.
5 Incredible place. Very tasty. I suggest showing around 5pm when there is not a lot of people waiting to be seated.
3 Overall, the food was decent but the initial serviced sucked. I understand it's busy but when a table is ready, you're supposed to receive a text from them. When we went to check on our table, she deleted our name off the list and we didn't even get a text. What???  Moving onto food... My friend and I had the Dan Dan Noodles, Beef Tendon in Chili Oil and Spicy Dry Pot with Fish. This was definitely enough food between two people. Our favorite was the dan dan noodles, which had an amazing peanut chili oil sauce. Really good proportion to share between two people. The Spicy Dry Pot was not the best. It was very salty and was not a level 10 spice at all, as described on the menu. In fact, probably just a 5 level spicy... There were only a few pieces of lotus root and mushrooms with fried fish filet. The Beef tendon in chili oil was perfect, their chili oil had a distinct flavor and we loved it.   Although I left satisfied with my meal, later that night my stomach was not satisfied at all and everything came out the opposite way it went in. It was horrible. Not sure if I'll be back..
5 Love this place! I have a gluten allergy and the staff was beyond accommodating. Usually I am forced to avoid Chinese food because they cannot make most of the dishes without wheat. However, the waiter was able to make alterations to the order so I could eat it. The food was delicious and I will definitely return soon.
4 Great spot in the East Village to fix your Sichuan cravings. I've come multiple times now with various party sizes and the service has always been consistent and attentive.  Regarding the food, you can't really go wrong with anything here. With a bigger crowd, we'll typically do family style (dry hot pot, cumin lamb, green beans are our regular choices). When I just grab my own entree, I always go for the dan dan noodles. Never disappointed!
4 This is pretty great Chinese food.  It isn't your run-of-the-mill Chinese restaurant, in that you choose a style of cooking, and then you can add a protein and other items to your meal.  The food is a bit spicy so if you are sensitive make sure you order something on the more mild side.  The restaurant can get crowded, but take out is good as well.  Cool place to try out if you are tired of the usual General Tso's chicken and fried rice.
5 Oh my goodness. That Dan dan noodles. They must put some crack in there because I can have it for days. Dry pepper style was great too, so was the 3 cup chicken. All around wonderful place and worth the 45-minute dinner service wait.
1 Ordered Dan Dan vegetarian noodles and spicy cucumber.   Dan Dan Noodles were essentially boiled overdone noodles with a bitter mildly spicy chilli oil flavour. The chillie oil tasted almost burned.  Resturant was quite busy but as per the Dan Dan Noodle dish quite a bit over rated gave up eating after five bites  Also 15 mins into my order and never got my spicy cucumbers however a sign of really bad service, ad I got billed for them at the checkout.
4 The place is not bad, we were seated right the way on Tuesday afternoon. The cucumber In chili was much sweeter than I expected, the shrimp in chili sauce was really tasty ,but the scallion pancake was a bit dry for my taste. oh and they don't serve cold soda :/
4 Love the Dan Dan noodles! Also, they aren't kidding when they say things are spicy on their menu. Drink a lot of water and enjoy the burn.  This place gets crowded and loud inside, and the wait is sometimes crazy. Go at an odd hour, and don't be deterred by the heat emanating from all the sweaty customers.
4 Szechuan is definitely not a Miami speciality, so I was eager to get some during my visit to NYC. I arrived with a group of six on a Thursday night and we were told there was about a 30 minute wait. My friend lives nearby, so we headed to her place while we waited for a text from the restaurant. It took longer than 30 minutes to be called back, but it is what it is... They only take reservations for parties of 8 or more (for which they also do a tasting menu for $25 per person which seems like a great deal).   We immediately got to ordering once seated. I trusted my friends that had been here before and they opted for a couple orders of:  - Dumplings in Chili Oil  - Dan Dan Noodle  - Dry Pepper Chicken  - String Beans w/ Minced Pork   What can I say... It was all SO GOOD. The Dan Dan Noodles were definitely my favorite, but the dry pepper chicken packed a perfect and addicting punch. I would have never ordered the string beans on my own but DO IT and thank me later. They rate the dishes on a spice scale from 1-10 and can adapt accordingly. I prefer spicy so was in heaven, but be warned, Han Dynasty can bring the heat!  The food came flying out fast which was welcomed since we waited for awhile. All in all, the bill totaled to about $15 a person and we were stuffed! Service was good. I never had to ask for my water to be refilled which is always a plus.  It seems like this spot is popular for group dinners. While they serve beer and wine, it seemed like a lot of tables had their own bottles of wine, so maybe call and ask about the BYOB policy.
5 We stepped in this restaurant when visiting NYC. The room was full, luckily someone canceled their reservation and we got a table shortly. All I can say is that they have very fast and good service. Normally I would drink a gallon of water after eating in a Chinese restaurant. Not this time. I guess they don't use as much MSG as other places.  Highly recommended!
3 I'll start off with good: The wontons in chili oil were great! Now for the bad: The Hot Sauce Tofu was bland and not at all spicy and the Dan Dan Noodles were bland and mushy. Will not order from here again, not to mention spending the extra $$ to order delivery from via Caviar.
3 Very crowded on a Sunday night. Had scallion pancakes which were excellent and light not doughy (actually best I ever had although my wife felt they were a little greasy). Won tons in sesame oil which were average and then chicken in pot that I enjoyed a lot, and my wife had chicken with black bean sauce which she said was the chewy chicken type and my daughter had chicken with garlic sauce. Both stated they would not come back. I would but eould first explore the other 1000 oriental restaurants in NYC.
5 Most important - delicious food and served piping hot. The bartender was kind and efficient. Reasonable prices.
5 Dan Dan noodles, Cumin style chicken and the fried rice are my staple favorites. Long wait times on weekends but extremely quick service!!
5 First time having authentic Szechuan and it sure as hell won't be the last!  I first attempted to eat here on a Friday night around 9pm and could not stick out the 1.5 hour long wait as we were straight up ravenous. Luckily grabbed a meal Saturday night and boy oh boy were we impressed!  Dan dan noodles come straight to your table within minutes and is freshly tossed with yummy bits of ground pork and a fiery chili oil. BANGIN. The pepper wings were super crispy and hot but not as spicy as I thought it'd be. Ordered the cumin style beef and was disappointed to discover that I had meant to order a different dish with more sauce. Still yummy tho! We ordered everything at a nice spice level of 8 and it was deliciously doable.  Paired with a full bar and awesome service, this place is a solid 5 stars. Can't wait to be back!
2 Really sad that they changed the recipe. The Dan Dan noodles that they became so well known for just lacks the spicy kick that it used to have. They are using different noodles now too.
1 Saw the reviews for this place and thought I'd give it a try. I ordered the dry pepper chicken lunch special ($8.70) - definitely not worth it. Literally all fried coating (less than 1/5 of this dish I would consider chicken), plus a tiny little box of rice. I've tried plenty of lunch specials from Chinese restaurants in downtown Manhattan, and this has definitely been the worst.  Also, to add insult to injury, I called three times to place my order, but no one picked up. Would not recommend.
1 The bartender is soooo mean!!!! Not friendly at all!!!!  When we want to order, she literally yelled at us with the attitude.  We didn't do anything at all, just got our seat at the bar and wanted to order!  That's all!!! What's that attitude from?!!!!   Ahhhh!!!!
1 Hostess was rude and quite condescending. Place was so loud couldn't hear myself think. Food was average, not as good as Chinatown and much more expensive. Seems to cater to college crowd. Oh! Most importantly found a stone in one of my dishes. Almost broke my tooth on it. Beware!!!! Watch out while you partake.
4 Han Dynasty always satisfies my Szechuan cravings. My favorites are the beef and tripe in hot chili oil, dry pepper fish and dry pot style beef. The food is just the right amount of spice and tastes amazing. The staff is also friendly. Only downsides are the wait and the price. The three dishes I order always come out to around $50.
4 One of the best Chinese Szechuan restaurants in the city. Menu favorites - Dan dan noodles and dry pepper wings!
1 Two people. Dine-in dinner. First time.   Waited half an hour as requested. Their food is not to my taste (should've known cumin was a weird Chinese spice). Not appetizing, we had so much leftovers we just gave it in doggy bags on to the security guard across the street. Ordered the cumin style lamb and some spicy dumplings. Again, not my cup of tea. Especially for $30. West lake soup is a no go. Very very loud. Will be going to Mulan East instead.
5 This is the best Chinese I've had in New York. The wait is long but worth it. They have levels of spiciness on the menu but I don't think they are that accurate. We got the dry hot pot chicken (supposed to be a 10 on the spicy level). While it was hot, it was not as unbearable as a 10 should be - so don't be afraid to go for the entrées at the higher numbers! The Dan Dan noodles are very good and the dry pepper wings are sizzling hot and cooked to order! I would definitely come back here - but from what I saw go on at the takeout counter - it was a huge cluster f**k where people were getting really pissed that their orders weren't ready. I'd avoid that
4 one of the best spicy Szechuan food place in town. we ordered dry pot style and hot sauce style both are a must try.
5 Let me tell you! First of all, I love Chinese Food !!!  By far, one of the elite Chinese restaurants in NYC. The food is super .. I mean super amazing.  The service is special and guess what .. what? They really take care of their customers.  I cannot wait to come back and eat here. I was so impressed, I wanted to make sure the staff was aware of how special they are. What is special? I my opinion, keeping the customers/clients very happy.  Han Dynasty please don't stop doing what you do!  Thank you so much !!!
5 Han Dynasty is probably the best American Chinese restaurant I've been to. Service is great. The thing I keep going back for is the cumin beef. So much flavor. I prefer the location on the upper west side because the flavors seem to shine there more so than the location near union square.   Enjoy!
5 This is the real deal right here. Best Chinese I have found in NYC yet. Stumbled upon by accident on a Tuesday night. Looked very busy so took a chance. Went for the Hot Sauce Shrimp. Extremely flavorful and bursting with Szechuan yumminess. Huge portion. This place delivers all over the city so it will become a regular for me. Service very quick, polite and efficient. I was in and out in about 15 minutes even though they were slammed.
5 Loved the food! We came here for dinner last night, and as expected it was packed with an hour and a half wait, which was totally worth it!!  I love how they had a lot a vegetarian options ( lack of it can be an issue for vegetarians at some places). Me and another friend ( also a vegetarian) got the veggie spring rolls, Dan Dan noodles( best part of the menu, hands down!! ), and the tofu and veggies in garlic sauce. Everything was delicious. Our friends got a lot of variations in chicken , fish and pork and they loved it! The time between ordering our food and having it on the table was quite short, which is an another plus. Definitely coming back soon!
5 Been looking for good Sichuan and this hits the spot!  The place fills up quick so recommend going early, but they also have a good texting system for the waitlist.  The Wontons in Chili Oil and Dan Dan Noodle are must-orders, every time!  The noodles come in a big bowl so great for sharing amongst a small group.  Also recommend the Hot Sauce Style Fish, Dry Pepper Style Chicken and Pea Leaves w/ Garlic -- I basically listed every dish I've had here!  And will definitely be back for more.  I will say that the food is slightly pricey so will ding the review to 4.5 but the food is authentic and delicious.
3 Got introduce to this place by my sister and I can't say it disappointed too much. Granted the service sucked ass but the food made up for it. Normally has a heck of a wait but on our visit we were lucky thee was on wait and got in and out In a timely manner  DAN DAN NOODLES and DRY PEPPER CHICKEN is all I've ever gotten from here DAN DAN NOODLES is a egg noodle that is basically dry and tossed in a chili oil sauce that is pretty darn good and big enough to share with another person or so.   DRY PEPPER CHICKEN is a pretty good amount portion wise. The chicken itself I crispy and has great flavoring with just enough heat for a little kick back.  Service is what sucks here. Wait staff can be rude, impatient. and condescending. Unfortunately has a waiter that was so rude. Came to ask us what we wanted as soon as we sat down and literally rolled his eyes when we said we needed a few minutes. When he came back we asked him a few questions about certain items on the menu to which he turned his back to us and walked away when he didn't feel like answering our questions anymore.  Parking.... Do I even need to talk about parking? I mean who drives in NYC? And let's be serious, any establishment in NYC has scarce ass parking and you'll be circling to find parking for at least an hour.
4 a not bad restaurant in east village....the black bean fish is awesome
4 WOW! Delicious, piping hot chinese cuisine served fast and with a smile.  Try the Dan Dan Noodles...fantastic. Also had Kung Pao shrimp, and a chicken dish, though I forget exactly what (it was great too).  Scallion pancakes were top notch, fluffy and chewy but without the grease that you get in other places.  We were a party of 3, and went at about 1:30 this past Sunday, Aug 28th.  We waited maybe 3 minutes before getting a seat though during our meal I did notice that the line for a table started to back out the door on to 3rd ave.  I would not have expected that on a late August Sunday in NYC when most of the cool and groovy peeps are on Fire Island or in the Hamptons, and especially this particular week, where so many others go on vacation leading in to the Memorial Day holiday.  My point is, if it was this crowded in the middle of the afternoon on a random Sunday when Manhattan is at its emptiest, then if you do go to Han Dynasty (and you SHOULD), then be patient.  The turnover is relatively quick and the food is worth it.  Prices are also very reasonable. Enjoy!
1 Anyone who said this restaurant is good, are you out of your mind??!! Or have you ever taken a single bite of real delicious Chinese food??? Dan Dan noodle was so shitty. The goddamned Dry pot was nightmare. Beef and trixxx made me wanna throw up. I barely wrote negative reviews. But this Han dynasty just ruined my lunch.  没有夸张，我觉得大部分美国的中餐就算不好吃，但也还行。第一次觉得难吃和恶心的，就是这家。另外他家计算在小票上的建议小费是偷偷把税也加进去的，大家注意。
4 In my opinion one of the best Chinese food in NYC. It ranges from super spicy to mild. It is a quick meal even though it's super busy. The Dan Dan noddles are the best thing on earth. The prices are good and you can have a wide variety off choices. Try something new every time because you'll be coming back.
4 Solid Szechuan food in the East Village. Most dishes here are very spicy, so proceed with caution. If you order the Dan Dan Noodles, spicy won-tons in chili oil, scallion pancakes, cumin lamb and the pea-shoots in garlic, you will be a happy camper.   It's all about the art of ordering the right combination of dishes that compliment each other. Each dish is meant to create a supporting role to the entire meal. Understanding the flow of a meal is the key to maximum enjoyment.   Make sure to correctly apply the space bar when emailing friends about this place. It's Han Dynasty, not Handy nasty. Careful. There's nothing nasty about this place, ok, well except for the noise level, it's terribly loud here.
4 Wanted to try this restaurant a while back, good choice i made. Food was very tasty and the spiciness wasn't too hot as i expected, but they need to improve the air conditioning on the location, hence my one star deduction. Overall friendly staff and good food!
4 good place to dine in, the food there were pretty good and very affordable. but will only get 4 stars because the AC in there wasnt good in a hot summer other than that good place to eat.
5 Long long long lines but the food is bloody good. My go-to are the Dan Dan noodles. Quick service and cheap! Tastes even better on a cold winter evening.
5 Quick Summary: Excellent Food and Service. I would highly recommend going if you're in the mood for Chinese.  Came in on a Tuesday night and the restaurant was still pretty full, had to wait no more than five minutes for a table as the restaurant is quite large and they do a good job of turning over tables pretty quickly.  Our server displayed the perfect balance of being helpful without being overbearing and did a great job of explaining how the "head index" a scale of 1-10 worked. Also, as it was myself and girlfriend, let us know that a single appetizer and entree would be more than sufficient for us (I wish we listened, we ordered two appetizers with an entree and were very full by the end).   The food portions as stated are larger and I would say that ordering a single appetizer and entree per couple is more than sufficient as our waitress had said. The one thing that I believe goes unmentioned is the great beer selection that they have on tap and in bottles, very impressive.   As for the food, we ordered the Dan Dan noodles, spicy cucumber and Garlic chicken, both were excellent! One thing I failed to mention is that you can adjust any dishes "heat level", so we decided to ratchet up the heat on the garlic chicken to a five and left the Dan Dan noodles at a perfectly spiced 6.   Great restaurant and highly recommend going if you're dining in the Upper West Side.
2 Terrible service, rude staff.  I felt rushed the whole time and got small portions on the main dishes Food tasted very good though.  Wonton soup was very good and was enough for 3 people.
2 Mediocre white washed Chinese food. Props to the staff for listening to the no oil and no MSG requests. Spicy tofu, rated a seven, was temperature wise super hot but not at all spicy. Excessive cornstarch. Dearth of flavor.
5 This place is always packed and is impossible to go in during the weekend.  The place is so small that it is hard to stand inside waiting for a table.  It is best to go with small party, like 2 people.  But the dishes are amazing, they are very well seasoned and flavorful.  Servers are not super attentive due to the volume of customers and how packed the place is.  Definitely go on a weeknight if possible to avoid the craziness.
4 Just go for the food. It's really tasty and I can assure you that your taste buds will have a gala time. Don't go here if you want exceptional service; they really don't care on that level. We have come here 4 times and all 4 times we have had the strangest of service. Sometimes your food comes together and all hot..sometimes it's one dish comes and the other will take another 20 minutes to arrive. In terms of portion we feel they are doing some cost cutting- slightly stingy on the portion- especially the fish and meat.
3 The packaging of the dan dan noodle (veg) into a tall plastic container for the EatArcade $5 pickup didn't lend itself to a consistent product (even after closing it and shaking and other attempts at mixing), but the potential was there, with a few bites being good, but most being heavy and lacking any great Szechuan kick.
5 I'm always on a search for Dan Dan noodles when I'm in the city.  Not realizing it I came back to the same place I've been to get Dan Dan. They were delicious just like the first time I was here. This time I sat at the bar and I was waited on by a tall thin gentleman. He was great, friendly, nice, and funny. He was also very helpfull, he was telling me places he enjoys going to in the city. So this was another successful visit and I will be back next year.
3 beef noodles. Very tasty. definitely feels like the most unhealthy thing I have ever eaten though. Will need to wait a while before going back.
4 This place is a gem. There is always a wait. We tried the spicy crispy cucumber, Dan Dan noodles, dry pot Style chicken. Can't wait to try other styles. Truly authentic Hunan dishes.  The service is fast but the staff could be a little friendlier though.
5 The dry pepper chicken wings are phenomenal. I ate as take out and dipped them in ranch+hot sauce. Unreal. Will definitely order again.
5 I have to say, I was pretty impressed with the authenticity of this cuisine. I've passed by this place many times and made a couple of bad judgments based on their sign and name, "Han Dynasty." Just seemed like another American Chinese restaurant where they serve you chicken and broccoli. Decided to give this spot a try based on Yelp reviews. We ordered the spicy beef noodle soup, scallion pancake, eggplant in garlic sauce, the dry pepper fish, and the Taiwanese sausage fried rice. The beef noodle soup was really good, perfect combo of flavor and spice. It just looks a lot more intimidating than it tastes. I can't really tolerate spice, but this one was okay for me. The spice doesn't linger and so it was perfect. Might be our favorite new place to get spicy beef noodle soup. The beef was also very tender which is always a plus. Scallion pancake as pretty good, was thin and not overloaded with flour. I hate the ones where they stuff you up with flour. I usually like thin ones with lots of scallions. The sauce they gave you with the scallion pancakes was also different from other restaurants. They usually give you sweetened soy sauce and sometimes vinegar but this was a special sauce they made. I'm not sure what they put in it. The eggplant was just okay. I've had better and this one was nothing special, but still good. The dry pepper fish was SO good and flavorful! It is not as spicy as it looks since it is fried fish and it doesn't absorb all the chili. Next time I will try the dry pepper chicken. This dish was yummy. Last was the Taiwanese sausage fried rice. This was really good. I know it's just fried rice, but with the Taiwanese sausage, it really made a difference and I wanted to devour the whole dish. It's because it was just fried rice and still so damn good, which made it very impressive to me. I def have to come back here and try other dishes like the ma po tofu, and dan dan noodles. I think for its location, price and flavors, this might be one of my fav Sichuan style foods! Very glad I tried this place today!
3 Han Dynasty isn't the game-changing Chinese restaurant its fans from Philadelphia or the New York press will have you believe. It does successfully present elements of Hunan and Sichuan cuisine in ways not too frequently found on the island. But anyone who thinks they are getting the full Sichuan experience here at a bit mistaken.   I still recommend the restaurant, especially at lunch. The lunch-sized portions are perfect for business diners who won't be eating family style and the price point is shockingly low. I came with a couple clients who had a conference next door, who surprised me by taking me up on the offer to come here.   We started with some wontons in chili oil, which had nice skins, although disappointed on the spice front. I'm suspicious when this dish doesn't contain the fire hot that I'm used to Sichuan province or even other parts of China. I recognize that this doesn't meant the chef doesn't know how to prepare the dish, but it still seems somewhat off.   My main course was the cumin chicken, which works a set of spices into a pleasing dry rub dish.   Now there was a bit of a hiccup where one entree didn't appear until long, long after the after two portions. We inquired about this and our waiter sprung into action, delivering a free set of chicken wings when it became clear that the main course wouldn't be coming any time soon. I appreciated the gesture, which turned what could be a very awkward situation into something that just required a small laugh or two.   An upgrade over some other "Sichuan" options around town, but not the same as what you'll find in Flushing.
4 My son wanted "good Chinese food" while we were in New York.  Han Dynasty didn't disappoint.  The reviews on Yelp got us there and lived up.  The Kung Pao Chicken, Lo Mein and dumpling in Chili oil, you can't go wrong.
4 This placed calmed my grudge against the BaoHaus and comforted me with some real Taiwanese bums!  The cucumber in the cold dishes is surprisingly tasty and unique. Strongly recommend.
3 When this place opened it filled a void in the neighborhood. A really good Chinese restaurant, even if it was a bit pricey. We were there when it  first opened and it was quiet with friendly service. However, it soon became the "hot" place to go.  I can no longer recommend it. It is noisy, crowded, often with a long wait to be seated. Worse the staff seems in a hurry to rush you out and turn over the table. Yes, the food is good but there are now as good or better choices a block away. E.g. Mulan East (3rd Ave. between 10th & 11th).  Don't believe all the hype.
5 Excellent all around.  Great atmosphere, service, and food.  Good portions to share family style at an affordable price.
4 Without fail, this restaurant is always teeming with people and was curious about how good the food was - so I stopped by. I decided to order very basic food to get a measure of the place.  I ordered Dan Dan noodles for take out and enjoyed every last bit of it.  Also, while I was waiting for my food to be prepared, I noticed plates were nearly cleaned off, so everything else must have been good as well.  I will definitely be back!   This is a great Chinese restaurant in the neighborhood.
5 Dan Dan noodles, crispy chicken, cumin lamb. Epic.  This is the sort of place you want to order family style.
3 They used to be good but they changed their recipes.  I love their Dan Dan noodles before, it was made with yellow egg noodle and used to be spicy so good. Now they have use the white noodle and the dish taste bland and not hot at all. The white noodle is more authentic like other places but the taste changed to more mild and not as spicy.   They changed Kung Po Chicken too. Before it was white meat and not deep fried. Now Kung Po Chicken is dark meat deep fried like you get from Chinese take out.   I used to keep coming back before because they taste better than Hot Kitchen down couple blocks, but now they change recipes/cook/owner? I think Hot Kitchen tastes better and more authentic.
4 Came here tonight with my friend and had an incredible dinner. The place was packed but the wait wasn't very long. We got to the table and picked two items and told our waiter, who was very friendly and enthusiastic to "surprise us" with the third dish. He brought us out the veggie Dan Dan noodles which were my favorite thing we got! The service was fast and the food was all different and delicious. We ordered the garlic chicken, the spicy cucumbers and the Dan Dan noodles. Great experience. Highly recommend
4 This has to be one of the best Chinese restaurants I have been to in NYC. To start we had the Dan Dan noodles. Wow those were really tasty! Next my table shared an eggplant dish, a tofu dish and a dry rub spicy chicken dish. It was all really good. Patience is required at this restaurant. They don't take reservations for small groups, so be prepared to wait.
5 My two friends from New York suggested this spot for dinner and I know why.  The food is amazing.  We came on a Saturday night around 6 and understandably there was quite a wait, however, my friends were determined to show me why it was worth it.  After about 35 minutes we were seated and were offered tea and water.  We ordered the "famous" Dan Dan Noodles, Scallion Style Beef and Fried Rice.  Everything was amazing but the Dan Dan Noodles really stood out.  It was the perfect blend of spice and really brought the whole meal together.  I would definitely visit this place again next time I'm in NYC.
4 Came here on a Sat night and it was packed! They told me it was an hour wait, but it was maybe around 30-40 mins? They serve food FAST. The dan dan noodles are a must get! The spice had a kick to it and the noodles were chewy. I could have that sauce with all of my food! I shall be back (tmrw)!
1 I have always been a fan of Han Dynasty in Philadelphia and New York both until last night. I wanted to get dinner at Xian famous foods but they closed early so decided to go to Han Dynasty East Village location. To my surprise the menu seemed completely overpriced and there is a $1 price difference between the website menu and order for pickup app ChowNow, which seems unethical.  Anyhow, I ended up ordering the Kung Pao chicken and it tasted just like a frozen kung pao you get from the store in the bag. No schezuan authentic flavor, not spicy at all (I requested spice level 8), and the chicken had an unappealing texture. So disappointed!
5 I haven't been out for Chinese food in a long time but my friend recommended Han Dynasty and it didn't disappoint.  We ordered several appetizers and shared them - spicy wontons, spicy crunchy cucumber, scallion pancakes and spring rolls. Everything was excellent - I especially loved the wontons and cucumbers.  Main courses were Dan Dan noodles - which are in a peanut sauce - which I don't do...but my companions loved it. We also shared spicy shrimp (fried) and a tofu/mushroom dish in a sweet and sour brown sauce served with crispy rice....this was absolutely wonderful.   A pot of tea and a generous side of rice accompanied everything and service was super friendly and quick.  Loved it. Will be back.
4 Surprisingly authentic Chinese food for a place with such a gaudy sign. My friend and I stopped by on a whim on Friday night, and at 6:30PM they were already packed. Thankfully, there were two open spots at the bar that we happily accepted because we just wanted to eat and get out of there! We were pleased to find that a large majority of the patrons were Asian. That always bodes well for a restaurant serving Asian cuisine.   We ordered the scallion pancake appetizer and dry pepper fish to share. Both were excellent options, and my friend kept raving about how the dry pepper fish really hit the spot! The fish (cod) was battered, deep fried, and tossed in a red pepper rub. It was fresh out of the deep fryer and super yummy, but also insanely spicy!! I don't know how we managed to finish the entire plate without having to ask for an additional bowl of rice. Don't get me wrong though, it was extremely satisfying! We decided if we ever returned, we should come back with a larger group so that we could try more of the entrees, which - upon a quick purview of the dining room - all decently sized.   Since we were seated at the bar, the service was really quick. The bartender/cashier assisted in clearing our portion of the bar and processed our credit card quickly. I definitely wouldn't mind having a meal for one at the bar one of these days! See you next time, Han Dynasty!
5 Was here on Friday,May 20,2016,I just love this place nice and spicy.I had the Dan Dan Noodles and the Spicy Crispy Cucumber delicious.If you like spicy this is the place.I have eaten here before,the Double Cooked Style pork Belly is very good.I will be trying the whole menu. Love,love it.
5 We had chicken fried rice, dry pepper chicken and Dan Dan noodles. ALL of them were so delicious that I couldn't decide which one to eat first. Definitely is one of the best Chinese food that I have had.
5 This place is amazing. Beef cumin style and chicken fried with peppers is the best!!! Also the dumplings in oil sauce tastes incredible. Cheap, quick service, and great location!! Highly recommended!!!!
4 The fish with hot sauce had fewer slices of fish compared to other restaurants with similar price. Other than that, since it is hard to find a restaurant near NYU, I would say this place is not a bad choice.
4 Compared to the UWS location, the EV location just kills it, and I've eaten at both several times, both a la carte and tasting-menu style. The food tastes better and is less pricey here. Also I just feel there's more quality control in the EV restaurant. Today, we had the wonton in chili oil, the wings and the most pleasant surprise of them all, the mapo tofu. Everything was delicious and devoured. The wings are among the best in NYC, if not the best. The mapo tofu was spicy and awesome. Some might find all the chili oil greasy, but I say bring it on!
3 Our waiter was very patient with us - we wanted to know/order the signature, best-selling dishes. But we noticed it was all fried or served in chili oil so we wanted to know what else was good and a little lighter, kinder to our hearts. But the choices limited, little to none.   We tried: Spicy crispy cucumber  Dumplings in chili oil Dan Dan noodles Dry pepper style chicken  Spicy tofu fish  A few bites of each dish was sufficient. The dishes were tasty but average. Nothing detesting but nothing impressive.   Generally I like the cucumber dish but the sauce was very watery. Dumplings were skimpy on filling. Dan Dan noodles are always good but it is a heavy dish. Fried chicken is also always good. Once the fish came out (stew like dish), I felt like I almost had a heart attack.    Note to self: just don't order and eat too much next time
5 I would say this place is a must go in NYC. Fulfill your spicy food craving with the chicken wings pepper style ... Wonton soup is so flavorful and all the dishes are amazing... Definitely a staple
2 I was really hoping for some authentic Chinese food, but was disappointed with this place. It was good for what it was, but it was not very authentic. I ordered the green beans dish and it could've had a little more flavor with soy sauce. I ordered the garlic sauce eggplant dish and it lacked on minced pork which is a staple in garlic sauce dishes... Also the eggplants were not all consistently cooked, some were very soft and some harder. The kong pao chicken had breaded chicken pieces which is not authentic at all, no real Chinese restaurant does this! I don't think I'd order from here again unless I was desperate and had no other options.
4 Finally found a place that has REAL spicy food. I'm sick of the million Japanese restaurants in the area. This place is different and if you like Spice this is the place to goto!
5 I ordered delivery via Caviar, so I can't comment on the service. But the Dumplings in Chili Oil and the Dan Dan Noodles are absolutely delicious. I can see why the Dan Dan Noodles get such rave reviews now - the noodles are the perfect consistency and the sauce is addictive. On the authenticity front, they tasted less spicy and more nutty than the dan dan noodles I had when I visited Chengdu, but my memory might just be playing tricks on me...   I order dumplings in chili oil whenever I order from/dine at a Szechuan restaurant, and the ones from Han Dynasty were definitely up to standard. Will have to dine in next time and try their mapo tofu, scallion pancakes, etc.
4 Fast, fantastic and fun!! My boyfriend is obsessed with Chinese food, so when I suggested Chinese he was SO excited.... We got the sesame cold noodles to start then I had the scallion style chicken and Steven had the garlic style chicken. It was great; I had serious stomach pains all night, but I think it was from overindulging haha
4 Spicy and yummy. Crowded and loud. Distracted servers due to huge carry out business with average of ten delivery bike guys hovering at the bar to pick up orders. Dumplings were good but not as spicy as I expected.
5 So gooooood! Opted for this place on a weeknight for party of four and wait was about an hour (sadly). Good thing was that it wasn't cold that night and I had great company so I didn't mind the wait. My friends and I ordered a few dishes and shared it family-style to try everything out and I was not disappointed. I definitely recommend the dan dan noodles much like everyone else that has reviewed this place thus far. I have to point out that there was great service here! One of my friends can't eat pork and we didn't know that prior to ordering the dan dan noodles dish. Although we didn't mention it, our server overheard us and came back with a vegetarian version of the dan dan noodles. The veggie one had a different taste but was tasty nonetheless and we were blown away by the kindness of our server. I also had the claypot chicken (which was supposed to be super spicy but wasn't too bad for me because I have pretty high tolerance, scallion pancakes (great but nothing too special), and the bok choy with mushrooms. All in all, this was a pretty affordable meal with super great noms!
4 If you are searching for a lip smacking Indo chinese food then you are the right place.Perfect blend of spices and delicious food.oh yes and they ask you to rate your capacity of eating spicy so be careful when you say 8 or 9. Chicken fried rice,pork dumpling and their curries is what I tried and would recommend. Definitely suits my palate PS: Here Indo is Indian
3 Dan Dan noodles - that's what you want to order alongside any protein of your choice. The hot tea they give is mediocre, get a drink or just stick with the water. Service is above average for a Chinese restaurant in this price bracket. It's popular so make reservations especially in the evening times. The only downside to this place is it seems their one and only speciality is the noodles everything else is a tad lacklustre.
3 It was a long wait. It's rated one of the best sczechuang restaurant in the city, but the flavor was not that impressed.
1 Went with a group of coworkers on a rainy, overcast day. Waited 40 minutes after ordering, only two apps came out. The spicy cucumbers were good, the chicken wings crisp, the rice, rice. Evidently they prioritize takeout over in-restaurant patrons. Fun countertop though!
4 Very authentic place.  Very spicy as well; however, there are plenty of options if that's not what you're into.  Can be a bit of a wait but the place is great with texting you when your table is ready.
4 UPDATE : 05/01/2016 So I've been here tons now. I love it here. You gotta love spicy to truly appreciate what's being done at Han. The dandan noodles are off the hook. Perfectly tender but not soggy and the spice and meat with chili are delicious. The ambiance is super loud almost obnoxious at times. But you'll be too busy tearing up and sweating to care. Dumplings in chili, yum. Chicken with peppers and onions, yum. The WINGS ARE THE BEST THING IVE EVER HAD Asian food wise. The one thing I've had here that just fell flat and short for for me was the seafood hotpot. It just tasted like oil and chili but not hot or flavorful, just bland oil. Gross.  Today I had soup, the braised beef (not the spicy beef easily confused) BRAISED beef soup w noodles. I asked for it spicy and then took the peppers and scallion that were left on the wing plate and poured into my soup.... Whattttt!? Amazing.  so basically I love it here. K? K. Bye.
5 Best Chinese food in the city. Dan Dan noodles and cold sesame are ridiculously good. Worth whatever wait they tell you at the door.
4 I love it... Definitely I want to try to come again!!! Try the Dan Dan Noodles,mapo tofu with pork. Also Chili Oil.. try that.. you will love it
4 First dinner in NY and our friends vouched this place was going to be the best food we had on our trip. They were almost right. They ordered all of the food for us, so I wasn't sure what we ordered. However, the dish that hit me was the chicken wings. They were so crispy and nicely dressed in sauce. The wait was long (about two hours), and the host felt bad for us so she gave us a table but with only 30 minutes to eat because there was a reservation coming in. She felt bad about that too, so the host gave us drinks on the house. Overall, good food, nice setting, but very long wait - so I hope you don't arrive on a super empty stomach. I got pretty hangry
5 Absolutely LOVE this place!  Their xiao long baos/soup dumplings are delicious! Soft skin, and not piping hot soup inside. There are quite a bit of options here, but I recommend the Black Truffle and the Pork/Crab. Pork XLBs are good too. I also loved their scallion pancake, and the Shanghai Lo Mien. Their Szechuan wontons are similar to other places around Chinatown - I have friend who LOVE this, but to me their XLBs are definitely the stars of the show. I also like the panfried pork dumplings! You also get complimentary hot tea. I like that this place is pretty spacious, and not too long of a wait. I highly recommend anyone to come here, it is one of my favorite spots in Chinatown! Also, they take credit cards! Game changer when you're in this area lol.  Can't wait to come back soon!
1 boy this place really went down the crapper. so sad. we had a few amazing meals shortly after it opened but after about a year of not being able to get a table due to crazy long lines we finally got in and discovered that the food quality has fallen to barely a notch above cheap takeout. There was a general lack of flavor in the sauces and cheap chewy meat. We ordered enochi mushroom which in the past has been such an amazingly luxurious dish but now is just gross glop over bitter watercress. The pan fried noodles turned into sloppy sponges almost immediately and the soup dumplings were really watery. Everything was bland even the black vinegar sauce for the dumplings. What happened? The one good thing is that now we wont feel bad about not being able to get a table!
4 One of the best soup dumplings in Chinatown. The scallion pancakes are also pretty good. They're crunchy on the outside but chewy in the inside.  The only bad side about this place is that it's such a tourist trap that it's always crowded and busy, making the wait 20-30mins long. The service is actually pretty great.
5 Amazing food! I ordered dumplings and Shanghai noodles. Hands down some of the best I've ever had. Came here right after the Chinese New Year parade, and although it was a bit crowded, we were seated within 20 minutes. The service was pretty good. Would definitely come back again.
3 This block of Chinatown is for the tourists who don't know what good Chinese food consists of. Everything we ordered tasted pretty "meh". Also, watch out for their receipt! They added on things we didn't order thinking we wouldn't realize..   Only giving it 3 stars because I appreciate it when restaurants say very clearly on the menu what dishes to be made with/without meat. Makes everyones life easier.  However at the end of the day, I would not return.
4 Loved this place! Classic Chinatown Spot with a short wait. Has tons of different dumplings. the XLB was impressive but ive had better. food was good great it didnt blow me away. Nice clean environment, roomy and quiet.
4 Black Truffle Soup Dumplings. I feel like such a sellout every time I order them, betraying the authenticity of my homeland, but they're so...effing...good. Like bite-sized, fungi-flavored crack. Ugh, I'm drooling just thinking about them. Wish they were on Seamless.  Other dishes are pretty straightforward and decent but rather forgettable. Sauteed rice cakes are always a winner, and the beef noodle soup will warm your tummy on a cold Nor'easter day.
3 Great place for hangovers! All the food tasted okay, the dumplings were really soupy and mushie. Servers were great. Will we come back? Probably not. The place was just okay.
3 I've been here twice now and to be honest, it's kind of in the middle for me. Don't get me wrong, there were parts that I liked but on my list of soup dumpling places, there are other locations that are higher up on my list.   The first time i came, I tried the truffle soup dumplings as well as the regular ones and scallion pancakes. I actually really like the flavor of the truffle soup dumplings. It helped that I split one portion with a friend - otherwise, I think it would've been too rich.   This time around, I ordered the regular soup dumplings again, in addition to the spicy stewed beef noodle soup, scallion pancakes, and the spicy Szechuan wontons.  The wontons were tasty but weren't spicy at all. I liked the texture of the noodles but it also wasn't spicy (even my sister commented on that). We also thought that both the noodle soup broth and the broth in the dumplings were a tiny bit on the sweet side, which I wasn't a fan of. Scallion pancakes were probably the best but you really can't go wrong with fried dough.   Prices were pretty decent in my opinion, especially for a place in Manhattan.
5 Went back and ordered some off the menu dishes - old style scallion noodles and the steamed sea bass with cucumber.... both were really good...  Definitely a top recommendation for Shanghai style Chinese food.. as I mentioned before they are in the top 5 places for XLb in my opinion!
3 The xlb is the most common dish mentioned on Yelp for this place. I've had a lot of xlb, and I don't really see anything special about the ones here. In fact, the skin was a little too thick. The meat and soup was ok but again fairly ordinary.   Other items were okay too. The Shanghai noodles were on par with other places. The lion head meatballs were fairly good.   Apparently this place usually has wait ... I'd say if there is a wait, go elsewhere! Plenty of options nearby.
4 I LOOVVEEE the soup dumplings. My favorite is actually the pork and truffle, it's so good! The crab one is great as well and the dumplings are comparable to the ones I had in Shanghai. So it's pretty great.   The other foods are ok, I ordered some pork and veggies, they were mediocre at best. In nyc, there are definitely better Chinese restaurants but maybe not the soup dumplings.  It's always crowded when I go, so be prepared to wait. It's pretty small but worth it! They only accept cash or Amex, which is weird... i would definitely recommend this
4 Cons: Do not get the scallion pancakes. It's a waste of calories unfortunately. I also felt the pork buns were kind of meh and had too much breading.   Pros; However, the soup dumplings really were the best I have ever had! I decided to switch it up and get the black truffle and loved the flavor. Definitely wait and poke a hole because they're super hot!   Be mindful they only take cash or AMEX (so weird, I know!). Service was fine and quick.
4 Decor: 4/5 The cute 3D xiao long bao outside really stands out in making this restaurant different from all the other ones in Chinatown! Once inside, I immediately blend into the loud and homey ambiance. It has pretty dim lighting, but it's decorated beautifully with Chinese lanterns. You know when they even place seats right smack in the middle of the entrance that this place garners plenty of customers.   Service: 5/5 These waiters are FAST, swerving between the crowded chairs to deliver various sorts of dishes to customers.   Food- Value: Reasonably Priced Pretty much normal pricing for Shanghainese food around here! And it's good too!  Scallion Pancake: $3.50 // 3/5 The scallion pancakes are made different here. They're much crispier and fried. I still prefer my traditional pancakes but I would still recommend for you to try! It's not bad and the sauce that comes with it compliments it well!   Steamed Tiny Buns with Pork (6): $5.75 // 4/5 I'm picky about the skin thickness of the dumplings, and if you're like me and prefer the skin on the thin side, then I would highly recommend these! The perfect lovely texture of the dumpling skin combined with the vinegar drenched soup is just heaven! I would give this a 5/5 but then I tried the truffle xiao long bao.   Black Truffle Soup Dumplings (6): $12.75 // 5/5 Ok, this is ridiculously expensive for 6 soup dumplings but I understand truffles must be hella expensive and I actually forgive them too cause they're so good! Nothing really stood out to me for the soup from the pork dumplings but with the truffles, they're another story! The truffles add so much more flavor and now if you add the vinegar too....just imagine that. They can take my money. (But of course, it'd be nice if they can lower it a dollar or two!)  Shanghai Lo Mein with Chicken: $8.75 (I think) // 3/5 Taste straight out of the wok with that fried, oily taste. It's a bit too oily for my taste but hey, it tasted good! However, it's really nothing special, and they only gave a few pieces of chicken.   That day, I had discovered my new go-to for thin-skinned soup dumplings! They're not the best but they're decent. And with my overall positive experience here, you can expect me back!
4 The soup dumplings are just right in this place! The dough is not too thin nor too thick! It's chewy and doughy enough to hold the soup when you were picking it up. The soup is flavorful with pork flavor! And a dash of the ginger vinegar! It's nom nom nom!!   The sauce of the shanghai style lo mein is good as well. You can taste the wok from the noodles! It comes with mushroom and vegetables as well. How we, the noodles are udon... not the typical shanghai style noodles I used to have. I guess it is hard to get the real thing in the states.  The wines chicken though! It's nom x 5!! The alcohol taste is strong! I loved it! The chicken is tender and filled with alcohol!   The fried pork chop, it's crispy outside but a little dry.   I'll come back for sure.
1 If I could leave a -1 star review I would. This place has really mediocre food and my friends and I just wanted soup dumplings since we were not hungry. There were four of us and we ordered 2 plates of soup dumplings and it was really just plain and meh. We asked for the check and then the lady came over and said that she was charging extra $4 of "openfood" since it did not come out to $5 a person- which is unheard of and we never read that anywhere This place has horrible service and they will charge your for random items that you do not even eat. Do not come here. Crazy we paid extra $4 for nothing
5 We spent Labor Day in Chinatown and we had no idea where we wanted to eat when we arrived, so we walked around just looking at menus and in windows and we decided to stop at Shanghai Asian Manor because the menu outside offered some dishes that my husband was interested in. We had a quick look at TA and Yelp and saw some good reviews, which is always encouraging. We were offered a shared table immediately, or we could wait 10 minutes for our own table, so we waited.  We were seated and straight away we were served a pot of black tea, which was delicious.   When ordering some of the dishes I had questions and the waiter pointed us in the right direction, which was super helpful and meant that we got exactly what we wanted. We were really grateful for this because we would have ended up with two different dishes had the waiter not been so helpful. We ended up ordered szechwan wontons, pork soup dumplings, chicken low mein, and General Tso's chicken.   The food came out within a very reasonable time - we didn't time it so I'm not sure exactly, but it didn't feel like we really waited long at all.  We were not at all prepared for how delicious this food was going to be. The broccoli that was served with the General Tso's chicken was so fresh and delicious, as was all the accompanying sauces that we had on the table. Both me and my husband loved the food and we really look forward to going back again. It'll be difficult to not just order the exact same food again, but even if we did, it would be worth it.   I have to also say that Chinese food quite often gives me a migraine, and I didn't experience this after this meal. I've no idea why, but I thought it worth noting in case anyone else suffers with this.
5 Came here by myself for lunch while having an extended lunch waiting for jury duty selection. The place is busy which is always a good sign and it didn't take long to be seated or to order.   I got tiny pork soup dumplings, scallion pancakes and steamed shrimp dumplings which were all great. My waiter warned me the shrimp dumplings are made/steamed to order so take ten minutes which was fine and worth it.   Very affordable, filled me up well for $15.
1 DO NOT ORDER THEIR EEL! My friends and I came here for lunch yesterday, and we got the worst symptoms of Food Poisoning! It has been 24+ hours and I am still puking and have diarrhea. I have been a long time customer of this restaurant, but yesterday will be my last visit.
5 Everyone must come here to try the Black Truffle soup dumpling! The right amount of soup and meat and their dumpling skin is thin, just to my liking. If you like thicker skin like those served in Joe Shanghai and Nan Xiang, you should give this a try!   My two other regular orders are the scallion pancake and crispy noodles with seafood. The scallion pancake came out piping hot and crispy with a side of delectable soy sauce dip. Price is ridiculously cheap, the scallion pancake is like $3.  The crispy noodles is amazing (it's like eating a thinner ramen noodle straight out of the package) with generous seafood servings.  I'll be a frequent diner since I haven't found any in midtown that serve the same type of crispy noodles!
4 Spent 30 years looking for the dry sauteed szechuan beef I remembered from Hwa Yuan Szechuan at 40 E Broadway and finally found it here.Yay.
4 I've been here twice with my boyfriend. Both times, we were seated with 2 other strangers at a table for 5 because the restaurant was super packed.   The first time was a great experience, we ended up chatting with the other couple and they even shared some of their food (true family style!) since they ordered too much. We ordered mapo tofu, eggplant with minced pork, and classic soup dumplings.   Since our last shared seating experience was positive, we gladly came back during the Saturday dinner rush. This time, holy sh*t... we were seated beside two guys with EXTREMELY BAD BODY ODOR.   SHOUT OUT to the waiter who realized/smelled our predicament. We seemed to have an unspoken agreement that he'd bring our food out ASAP. We ordered soup dumplings, scallion pancakes (they are actually deep fried), shrimp dumplings, and Wuxi spare ribs (meat came easily off the bones and it was very saucy). We were in and out in ~30 minutes.   I would definitely come back again, but with more hesitation for shared seating.
4 Xiao Long Bao (crab and pork) were amazing. The other dishes (wuxi spare ribs and fried duck) were also well sized and tasted pretty good. Price is good for what you are getting.  My one complaint was that the wined chicken was a bit over marinated and too heavy on the wine.
4 Probably the best XLB's I've had. Loved that they had a lot of soup inside. Everything else was pretty bland and mediocre, but the dumplings definitely won us over and they deserve the 4 Stars.
4 This is my go to whenever I'm craving Shanghainese food. One of my friends never tried so I brought her here for the famous soup dumplings. We ordered the pork and crab dumplings, seafood fried rice, Dan Dan noodles , some kind of vegetarian tofu appetizer and chicken lo mein. Everything tasted great and the waiters did not rush us even though we stayed for over 2 hours chatting.  Great place to eat and maybe will try their truffles dumplings next time.
1 The service is terrible. After the order was an hour late I called every 15min with the same answer "it will be there In a couple minutes". After 2 hours late I asked to speak to a manager who said they delivered my order to someone else an hour ago and offered to let me cancel my order. Don't order from these guys
5 Always consistently good shanghainese food.  The soup in the soup dumplings was generous and flavorful and doesn't fall apart when you pick it up  I always get either the shanghai pan fried noodle or the noodles with meat sauce depending if I want something fried or not! The pan fried noodles are crispy and drowned in a sauce with various veggies and proteins (seafood, chicken and beef). The noodles with meat sauce is cooked well but can feel a bit too heavy.
5 Quick service especially on a Friday night. If you arrive after 6 PM you should expect to wait at least fifteen to thirty minute wait for a table. Their pan fried bun is amazing. Just the right amount of meat filling and the bun isn't too heavy. It was very soft and fluffy. Be careful when eating it! It does get very hot! Their wontons are full of sauce! The portion size for the wonton was quite small however if you are ordering many small plates you should be ok. The soup dumplings were freshly made. Did not have to wait long to be served. There was about a ten minute wait for the dishes to start coming out after it was placed.
4 The beef lo mein is super good. I ordered it spicy but it was not as spicy as I was expected . It was more mild .
5 This is by far one of the best Shanghai soup dumplings places in Chinatown. Delicious fast, efficient & great service.   Everything about this place gives me the good feels cause everything that I have ate here has made my soul feel even better.   I'll let the pictures do justice.
1 Horrible service and the women on the phone was so impolite. They are out of the noodles I ordered and ask me to cancel my order and block me I the phone. Literally never had this kind of service before. Do not go order in this place
4 We only had dim sum dishes. I liked the sauces that came with all the different foods we ordered. The complimentary tea was just ok. I really liked the rice balls in wine and scallion pancake cuz I've never had that dishes like those before.
4 Truffle Soup dumplings ::drool:: Make sure you order enough to at least get 2 for yourself!! I only had one, this was over a week ago now, and I'm still kicking myself for not ordering more!   Found this place on Yelp. Thank you yelpers! Got there around 4pm on a Friday with my family of 8. After walking like 10 blocks from the subway, my family was all hitting their Hangry wall and probably would have killed me and ate me if we had to wait in a long line. (Yeah, they're savage like that.) But LUCK was on my side! The large group at the only large table was just leaving. So we were able to sit down in 5 minutes!! (I hear, it can be much longer)   The staff was friendly and pretty on point. Except if you really want water. It seemed like the one thing that was a hassle to get.   Ordered: #8 shrimp dumpling Black truffle dumpling #11 #38 Large egg drop #124 water cress w/ golden mushroom
5 I'm usually very critical of dumplings, but this place did a great job with both their steamed and fried dumplings! The meat is incredibly tasty, the shell is tightly wound, and the juice doesn't explode out of the dumplings when you bite into them. This place is a definite go-to for the dumplings! I would go again.
4 No frills, good food.   My cousin was craving soup dumplings and Chinatown seemed to be the half way point between all of us. We showed up to Shanghai Asian Manor a little before 7PM, before a rush of people came in. We didn't have to wait but after we were seated, I noticed the crowd by the door slowly growing as our meal went on. Service at Shanghai Asian Manor is great, the servers are friendly and attentive. The food comes out quickly and is quite tasty.  Between the three of us, we split (3) orders of pork soup dumplings, (1) order of the Szechuan-style wontons, (1) order of salt & pepper pork chops, (1) order of scallion pancakes and (1) large rice.  The soup dumplings were definitely tasty but my inner soup dumpling soul resides in Flushing. The wontons were SO good and very spicy. If my appetite allowed for it, I could've went for another order. The pork chops were filling, the portion was huge but was a little underwhelming without dowsing it in the dipping sauce. The scallion pancakes were OK. I highly regret not trying the truffle soup dumplings so I will definitely order that the next time around.  In general, I thought our meal here was great. I definitely plan to return in the near future to try out other menu items!
4 Excellent food, but a very long wait if you're coming in at normal meal times. The staff isn't very attentive, but they are at least friendly.
5 This is my favorite Shanghainese restaurant in NYC. I come here pretty often. It's one that I recommend to all my friends who visit because the food is delicious, the space is spacious (compared to Joe's Shanghai), and the price is affordable. You'll really get the bang for your buck here.   Here are some dishes that I usually order that are musts: - Steamed tiny buns with pork (soup dumplings)  - Pan-fried pork dumplings (I usually don't order pan-fried dumplings at restaurants but theirs are really good) - Shanghai style pan-fried noodles  - Shanghai Lo Mien with mixed meat and shrimp  Sometimes, I'd also order their sesame chicken, fried rice, rice cakes, and Thai iced tea. I don't think you can really go wrong with anything on the menu. They also have photos of their dishes hanging on the walls - those are usually good!  There's also usually a long wait here especially during lunch and dinner. So go early and tell them your name to reserve your seats. But if you don't want to wait, their sister restaurant (I believe) is a few blocks away and it's called Shanghai Asian Cuisine. Bring cash! They used to accept credit card but now they only accept American Express.   Also, my photo does not do this place justice.
5 BEST soup dumplings ever!  I spent some time in Asia growing up and I have been looking for authentic tasting dumplings since then and I found it here in NY in China town.  They don't take reservations but I've never had to wait for too long.  IF you go before 6:30 you should get seated right away but weekends its always packed.
5 There are only 2 soup dumplings spots in NYC that I religiously go to. (I'm praying they're opening a Din Tai Fung soon in NYC). Nan Xiang Xiao Long Bao and Shanghai Asian Manor. I never have a bad time going here. The food comes out pretty quickly. We usually get the number 1 and 2 on the menu; two orders minimum of each of the soup dumplings. We usually top it off with fried tiny buns with pork. My friend ordered General Tso's chicken. I normally avoid any American Chinese concoction but I was dead wrong. The General Tso's chicken was pretty good. I ordered the rice cakes but it wasn't as chewy as I would like it to be. Be sure to bring cash as with most Chinese restaurant establishments. You can also never go wrong with Young Chow fried rice. Expect a 25-35 minute wait during dinner hours.
4 This place is more like 3.5, but I'll round up and give 4 stars.   Delicious soup dumplings. Tried one of each. The pork, pork and crab, and pork and truffle. One thing I thought was lacking is that there wasn't that much soup inside the dumplings. But the pork and truffle one was so flavorful and delicious, I would highly recommend.   Also tried some other things on their menu. The sesame chicken was ok, a little too sweet. The salt and pepper pork was also ok. The sauce it comes with didn't pair that great with the pork. The shrimp fried rice was standard and good. Can't go wrong there. And finally the Shanghai lo mein was the best fish besides the soup dumplings. They were chewy and so good but they give so little noodles. It was too little to share among 5 people.   Anyway, relatively good service and good food. Definitely get the bang for your buck. Would recommend this place.
3 Your average decent Asian/Chinese food place. Had the soup dumplings and Shanghai style Lo Mein. Both were nice and as expected. Did not have to wait for seating or service around lunch time on a Monday. Staff was friendly and quick to react.
5 Wow great truffle soup Dumplings the best in NYC.and the shrimps in fruit sauce. WOW WOW !!!
4 I got the Shanghai Chicken Lo Mein. The noodles were very good. The chicken was below average. It was pretty chewy. Also got the pork fried dumplings and those were amazing and flavorful. Friend got the chicken fried rice and that was really bad. Looked like it came out of a microwaved bag.
5 Din Tai Fung quality without the wait (no line for us, although others say differently), located in the heart of NY's Chinatown amongst numerous other excellent, delicious, and memorable choices. We were visiting from Minnesota so I can't say I have the breadth of experience in Chinatown cuisine as local would have - but it seems like Shanghai Asian Manor would be an exceptional restaurant anywhere but in NY it's just another really great restaurant in Chinatown.   Our soup dumplings were done just about as good as you can expect - soft, juicy, and full of flavor. Our favorite of the bunch were the steamed pork dumplings, which we got three stacks. Another good choice was the boiled pork and leek dumplings. Overall, the soup dumplings were well made although lacked somewhat in presentation and size compared to other places I've been to (namely, in Hong Kong an Shanghai, as well as Din Tai Fung in Seattle). However, the prices here absolutely blow all those other places out of the water.  Service was quick and efficient. We got our first batch of dumplings probably 5 minutes after our order. Restrooms are mega cramped and a little awkward since it is in the back where all the employees hang out (this place is TINY!). Cash or American Express only. Would definitely come back!
4 Ordered dumplings, bean curd soup, Chicken with hot peppers, broccoli and Their signature Watercress with golden mushrooms. Every dish was delicious and you can pick anything and not go wrong. Only downside was waiting in the frigid weather.
5 CALLING ALL DUMPLING LOVERS!!!!!  If you love dumplings as much as I do, you will love this place.  The atmosphere, servers, beer and of course the soup dumplings are notably amazing.  We were instantly seated at a table of our likely and were helped right away. I can't get enough of this place. Whenever I step foot in downtown Manhattan, I'm coming here.   I have to cut this review short because they just dropped off another order of soup dumplings at my table.
4 Short wait for a table was so worth it!  Great staff, better food, friendly atmosphere. Go with dim sum and be sure to get the #52 fried shrimp in special fruit sauce. It really is amazing. Cash or AMEX only.
4 Good spot in Chinatown. Busy. We went on Christmas Eve and had to wait 40 mins but worth it. Typical Chinatown spot, a bit nicer than some others in decor etc. Soup dumplings and fried dumplings are good. General Tso's chicken was tasty and large. Cat got a scallop dish which had plenty of scallops. Would return
5 PROTIP: CASH (or amex card) ONLY!!!  PROTIP: no dim sum carts  besides that, A MUST GO if you are a big xiao long bao (XLB, soup dumplings) fan! probably one of the better xlb places in the city. i will come back and update my review once i have tried every single place that offers xlb. but BONUS: they also make xue jiang bao! (pan fried bao) which wasn't bad.  we also ordered pan fried dumplings (guo tie) that were pretty good too!   honestly nothing was real bad here. i had a great christmas eve brunch with my fam here! a must recommend if you're craving soup dumplings and or just looking for some good authentic asian food!
5 4/5 Dumps for quality 5/5 Dumps for price  Solid XLBs
5 Cannot believe that I have never written a review for Shanghai Asian Manor.   This place is my second favorite soup dumpling restaurant in New York City. My favorite in the city is still Shanghai Café. The soup dumplings here contains less ginger taste. Of course also order the zha jiang mian.
4 The food is 5/5 but the service makes it a 4/5. The soup dumplings are the best! Better than Joe Shanghais with less of a crowd! Plus, the tale AMEX so it's a win-win.
4 Unfortunately was pressed for time, so I had to panic order and run right out the door. Hot and sour soup was tasty and hot. Pork steamed dumplings were good, but nothing to write home about. I would have loved more time to sample a few things, but it was definitely good enough to come back and investigate further.
4 The soup dumplings are the best. If I go back, I'm getting two orders of those.  Everything else I ordered was fine, but if you're going to go here, go here for the dumplings. The broth is rich. The texture is on point.  I'm going to shop around a little more before I come back, but I'll be thinking about those dumplings as I do. Every other soup dumpling I get will be stacked up against them.
4 Location: Located on Mott Street.  Wait: I came here during lunch on a weekday. There was no wait. On the weekends and in the evenings, there is a wait.  Seating: During the winter months, I would avoid sitting in the middle because you will feel the cool wind when someone enters.  Food: I tried the following: Steamed Tiny Buns With Crab Meat And Pork Steamed Tiny Buns With Pork  Fried Tiny Buns With Pork  Steamed Pork Dumplings Beef With Rice Cakes  I recommend them all. The Steamed Tiny Buns With Pork was so good that the group I was with ordered 3 more orders.  Overall, great Steam Tiny Buns (also known as xiao long bao). I highly recommend if you don't want to wait for Joe's Shanghai. Personally, maybe because of weather or because I was hungry, I thought the buns here were better.
5 Was originally looking for a different place to eat but as luck had it we ended up deciding to eat at Shanghai manor. When we arrived there was a 15 minute wait but it went buy really quickly. It was our first time eat dim sum and our waitress was kind in of to show how to eat. Absolutely delicious and recommend the black truffle, it was to die for!!! Food was great and the environment was friendly 10/10 would recommend. Just fyi it is cash only but I didn't mind.
3 Good dumplings, sub-par American Chinese staples, and decent Chinese food:  I ordered delivery from here, which came very quickly. The two types of shrimp dumplings were both good, but the shrimp fried rice and general tso chicken (I know, it's my fault for trying to get American Chinese) were below average. The green beans with pork was decent. It seems like the more authentic food is good here but if the Americanized dishes are going to be and, they shouldn't offer them at all...
4 My friend and I were taking in the city sights and felt like Chinese food.  She had never eaten xiao long bao (soup dumplings) so off we went.  When yelp got us there, lots of people waiting (weekend tho..) so we knew it was going to be a little bit.  It was cold and rainy, but it was all good because we were so hungry....and sometimes a line means....you might be in the right place.  When we checked in, they said about 20 to 30 minutes for a table...but we got called in after 10 minutes...score!  It was probably because there was just two of us.  What awaited inside was wall to wall people....only the clinking of chopsticks broke up the loud table chatter and kitchen orders....it was glorious...  We were sat at a small table for two and quickly placed our order.  My friend ordered a beer, and I began the 'soup dumpling instructions' on how not to completely burn your mouth and throat...like I have done so many times...  Our food quickly came...we ordered....  Fried pork dumplings -these were nice and crispy...and very plump.  They were soft on the inside and had a nice crunch on the outside.  There was lots of filling but it needed a tad more seasoning.  Shanghai style crispy noodle -this was really good.  It had a nice portion of 'crispy cake noodle' underneath and the sauce really soaked into it.  The veggies and meat tasted great...and this was the first plate that was cleaned.  Xiao long bao -the dumplings were good, and the flavor was delightful.  They came out piping hot, and had to show my friend how to poke out and drink the juice before consuming the meat.  Although, she became impatient and started eating them whole and ended up squirting dumpling juice all over me!  I guess there could be worse things...I smelled delicious for the rest of the day!  I will be back!
1 Food was ok but service was horrendous!! Placed an order in the morning for 6:15 delivery and the order was an hour late!! I have two kids. Called the restaurant and no apology just said they were busy. On a Monday really? Won't be ordering again.
4 Great service, excellent a quality. My go-to Chinese in New York. Try the fried mini buns, the sesame chicken and scallion pancake. Also do a mighty fine fried pork chop. Not the cheapest but reasonably priced and the shop has a lovely atmosphere. Would recommend.
5 Come here for soup dumplings! There's a few places that offer similar dishes but not like this one!   We arrived on a Saturday for a late lunch. The place is packed and there's a bit of a wait but only 10 minutes. Our go-to: soup dumplings and pan fried noodles. Service is fast.   Soup dumplings: The skin is on the thinner side but still holds the meat and soup well - none of them popped. There was a lot inside and the soup was delicious - flavorful and hot. The prices are also great and we end up spending less than what we would in Manhattan. Super easy and tempting to leave full and happy.  Update: Came here for dinner on a Friday night around 6pm which was just as they started to get very busy. The restaurant is small so there isn't really a waiting area, you stand next to people eating. Also got to try their Mapo Tofu. Spicy without being too crazy and the tofu was sooo silky!! Definitely recommend.
4 I've been to Shanghai Asian Manor twice now, although I've tried to go there three times... my one main problem with this place is it's so popular now that the wait is always 45 minutes to an hour! My dentist is close by so it's really great to stop in to an amazing Chinese restaurant after a trip to the dentist's office.   I came here over the weekend for takeout since the wait was just too long for me to deal with. I will say, the takeout speed is phenomenal and you get all your food within 10-15 minutes. To start, I always order the Scallion Pancakes. Their scallion pancakes are crispy and flavored to perfection. I definitely recommend getting a plate and sharing as the slices are big! The sauce that comes with it is the classic sauce that comes with most scallion pancakes - a bit salty, a bit tangy, very yummy.   The next thing I ordered were the Shrimp Dumplings, these are very similar to classic shrimp shumai. The skin of the dumplings were thin and chewy and the shrimp and dumpling mix was very satisfying and cleanses your mouth palette for your main dish.   As for my main dish, I got the Homemade Style Bean Curd. I didn't realize this had pork in it, so to all the people who don't like pork just keep this in mind. The tofu, however, was very delicious. It's almost like General Tso style tofu, with their own homemade sauce. Top the tofu on rice and you got yourself a classic yummy Chinese dish.   A general plus is their serving size is huge! Chinese restaurants sell vegetables/meat in terms of a whole plate, not like restaurants that usually serve your carbs and protein all on one plate. Therefore, you're getting a lot of entree for your money. I made my dish into 2 meals, this place has good quality food for good prices. Just beware of the wait since everyone wants to come here!
4 Solid Chinese food in Chinatown. Came here on a Sunday night and there was a bit of a wait but not bad for a group of four. No nonsense and no frills, just very good with a wide variety of food. If you're craving an authentic meal (but not uncomfortably authentic), this is the place for you. We had dim sum appetizers of tiny pork buns, scallion pancakes and soup dumplings as well as the chicken & shrimp hoisin dish, crispy duck, shrimp & squid, and eggplant noodles as entrees. All delicious. They have plenty of options for vegetarians as well. Would definitely recommend for anyone headed to Chinatown!
5 2nd trip to the manor. Came here with the family 6 years ago and actually forgot the name of this place so had to do some detective work to find it again.  First the caveats:  be prepared to wait. Put your name down and go shopping. Double whatever wait time they give to you. They told us 30 minutes. Ended up being close to an hour. Not their fault - the place is tiny and it's very popular so it is what it is. If you don't want to wait, go to the dozens of other average places around there.   On to why I love this place. I had schezwan dumplings and soup dumplings - they are not just my favorite here but maybe my favorite ever. Ridiculously good.  We also had lo mein, shrimp dumplings, vegetable wontons and some other standard Asian fare. I ate to the point of hallucinations and then whined about my discomfort for a few hours while still relishing the memory of what was just perfection.  We'll be back and hopefully sooner than 6 years from now.  No detective work this time - I'll definitely remember the Manor.
5 Szechuan dumplings and the soup dumplings with pork and black truffles were both absolutely out of this world delicious. Very nice place and I cannot wait to return. Went in around 11:15am on a Saturday and got seated right away. Started getting super busy there around 11:30am, so I recommend going in as soon as possible after they open at 11.
5 My dad and I walked in based on a recommendation from a friend with fairly measured expectations.   We were completely blown away. The Szechuan style wontons were out of this world good. The service was friendly and good-natured. The restaurant was bustling. I will be back without a doubt.   The line tends to move fairly quickly, so definitely stick around for a table.
5 The line passes pretty fast so make sure you stay nearby!   The green onion pancake was light and fluffy. Soup dumplings are also really good. Szechuan dumplings were delicious as well! The sauce that the dumplings are in make for a pretty good dipping sauce for other dumplings. The pan fried dumplings are also pretty solid.  My absolute favorite here is the shrimp dumplings! MUUUUST order. maybe 2.
5 The Dim Sum and fried rice were to die for. Had to wait as it was super busy, but it was definitely worth it!
3 My parents and I pretty often come to this location. They have delicious xiao long bao (the kind with delicate skin and piping hot soup inside). The store, compared to many other Chinatown spots, is also a bit larger and cleaner.   We also always order the scallion pancakes. They're fried crispy and are pretty tasty.   My parents actually didn't think this restaurant was that authentic, compared to the food they've had in Shanghai, but it was good enough for me.
5 Walked by and looked inside and saw the place was packed. First good sign.  Next the ambiance was nice and looked updated, not like most Chinatown restaurants. Second good sign. The food was fresh and delicious.  Lastly the restroom was clean. It definitely deserves 5 stars.
4 We visit New York from Maryland at least twice a year and shanghai Asian manor is always our lunch spot. Can't go wrong with the pork soup dumplings and shredded pork noodle soup! Servers are quick to take your order but be prepared to flag them down when you're ready to pay.
4 Came here as a group of four at 8:30pm on Friday and waited about 10 mins compared to an hour wait at three other places in the area. Excellent crabmeat soup dumplings...so juicy and very thin skin. It has only 6 pieces in each serving (compared to 8 at Shanghai Cafe which is one of our other favorites).   Wuxi spareribs were very flavorful although a bit on the sweet side. We weren't originally going to have rice but the sauce was so good that each of us finished a bowl. PS: No brown rice so only white rice available. Salt and pepper shrimp was great as well as the crispy duck. The tofu skin appetizer was great too. We left feeling full and happy.
4 We order delivery from here for the office and it is quick, affordable and delicious! We're working our way through the menu, but so far the Wontons Szechuan Style is a standout dish.
5 Got a hankering for xiaolongbao (soup dumplings) and after some research I decided this was the place to go in Chinatown. The other reviews were right, and these were the best I have had in the city. They even had a special black truffle XLB available that was aromatic and delicious, albeit expensive at $12.75 for 6. We also got a jumbo prawn dish with ginger and scallion and the mapo tofu which were top notch. I have add that the service was also excellent - something pretty rare in Chinatown these days.
5 Great food with good service. Came specifically to try the soup dumplings and they were excellent. The broth was seasoned perfectly and meat tender. I also had the egg drop soup which tasted fresh, not like it had been sitting in a pan for hours. The sesame chicken was still tender and juicy with the right amount of sauce. Overall some of the best Chinese food I've had.
5 This place takes me back to my culture. I have a hispanic/ latin culture. I am certainly not asian, but they make me feel like I am part of this. Great staffing. 5 minute to 20 minute break during lunch, but it is worth the wait. They treat you kindly. By the way, this place is so good they have known  me for 2 whole years. I suggest you try it out before you proceed to look at the comments below these. They are all good and the food is GREAT!
5 Quick service and delicious dumplings. We stopped in for a quick snack between meals. Soup dumplings were flavorful (we got the pork and then the pork and crab) and they didn't stick to each other or the container.
4 Been going here for years and everything on the menu is great, there is always a line at this location.  Food is delicious, fast, and price very reasonable.  There are so much on the menu I still haven't tried yer.
1 The owner of this place was super rude and basically started yelling us. We left immediately.  Worst experience ever!
5 Delicious.  Cheap.  Friendly.  Helpful.  Accommodating.  Semi clean.  Great flavors.  Many options.  Authentic.  Came back 2 days in a row cause my friends insisted on eating well and with a cheap bill. Typical authentic Asian place in Chinatown. Will be back again for sure!  Happy eating.
5 I really enjoyed my dinner here. Everything was tasty!! The wait was around 40 minutes but totally worth it! A must try if you are in Chinatown:) this place is cash or American Express only
5 Three friends and I were in the mood for some soup dumplings so we decided to give Shanghai Asian Manor a try and we weren't disappointed! We ordered their principal pork Xiao Long Bao or soup dumplings, steamed vegetable dumplings, steamed shrimp dumplings, and stir fried rice cakes with pork and veggies. The food was amazing and definitely filling! I also ordered their soybean milk which was so fresh with hint of sweetness that really helped wash everything down! There is usually a bit of a wait so put down your name and get a number as soon as you go in!
5 Its been almost 6 days since I went to Shanghai Manor for the first time. I feel a void now. I ask myself questions like "maybe you should've gotten that third order of dumplings?" or "why didn't you just get 200 of them to-go?"  To make things short, yes, make the trip to Shanghai Manor. You'll have a great meal with fantastic service go boot. Everyone from the hostess to the busboys were absolute sweethearts. The food was all delicious and the portions were reasonable. Amazing soup dumplings, although I haven't been to many other places, but I thought the thin dumpling skin and warm tasty broth was perfection. I ordered the braised noodles originally but was recommended to get lo mein instead, I'd definitely try it next time since it sounds interesting.   My only gripe is that the wait is long but I thought it was more than worth it. ~40 minutes on a Saturday night wasn't too bad. It goes by fast and we got to check out the dishes that other folks ordered. Although the menu is huge, I recommend going here with a smaller party (2-4 people) as it's a pretty tight place and the tables are smaller. Parking is rough and FYI, its cash only or American Express cards. A minor inconvenience for my new favorite Chinese restaurant.
5 Sometimes finding somewhere to eat in china town can be very overwhelming due to all the choice! And let's be honest, not every where is going to be good. I done my research ahead of time and all yelp roads led me here!   I actually tried to come here one Saturday but the wait was about 45 mins so I went elsewhere but today I was off of work and figured I'd have more luck getting a table which was true!   I ordered the vegetable dumplings to start which were really good! It made me think that the other dumplings on the menu must also be good and will deffo be back to try.   I also got the seafood noodle soup which was delicious! The seafood was all very fresh and it also came with baby corn, mange tour and carrots which is not something I have seen before. It's often just seafood or maybe some bak choi.  Seeing some of the other 'family style' dishes coming out, this strikes me as a good place to come for a big Sunday lunch or something with a group of friends. The menu has a lot of options and for sure will be back again!
5 Cheap and yummy food. This place was packed the weekend before when we first tried going. Glad this time around there was seating available. The food came out quickly but it was delicious and I was truly in heaven with the soup dumplings. Plus, they had one of my boyfriend's favorite dishes, which we don't typically see in every Shanghainese restaurant we go to, so that's a huge plus in my books. A happy bf = the world
5 This food was great and the service was good too. I ordered the steamed pork dumpling, egg drop soup and Shanghai Fried noodles  . Everything was hot and served quickly. Tons of flavor!!! Highly recommend this place! It was delicious!!!
4 I gave 4 stars for the price, service, and the soup dumplings.  My husband and I went there on Saturday lunch time and waited for 45 minuets which I guess that too bad.  We ordered  1) hot and sour soup - nothing special  2) soup dumplings with pork - I liked it because the thin flour filled with delicious broth and good amount of pork. 3) walnut shrimp- not recommend just a Mayo sauce poured on the deep fried shrimp.   Overall my opinion is this place is good for soup dumplings and price is very cheap.  They take only CASH or AMEX card.
4 XLB at Shanghai Asian Manor are very well done- I personally prefer the pure meat ones over the crab meat filling. The pure meat is cheaper and juicier, IMO, and the crab roe has a different flavor than that in China (It's not anyone's fault, just pretty sure different locales have different crab species) so it is a little weird. Not bad, but I still like the pure meat ones better. The skin is very thin but won't break if you pick it up gently.   The lion's head pot we got was fantastic, really flavorful and had a lot of food. Drunken chicken and kaofu-- both big quantities and the flavor is great. For the kaofu, SAM is not scared of using a lot of sugar which SHOULD BE done in Shanghainese cooking! Applause.  Shengjian (pan-fried dumplings) were solidly okay- they were the kind of thick skinned steamed Northern 包子 that looked a little pan-fried after taken out of the steamer. Not the most authentic.  Also, I wished SAM would offer more green leafy vegetables (jimaocai, doumiao- pea sprouts, etc). If you are in America and want Chinese veggies, NYC Chinatown in the place to go to find them and SAM is literally in Chinatown. It would be a nice addition to balance out meals.   Overall, will definitely come back for the XLB and clay pots!
5 This is the type of restaurant that every city should have one.  Dishes are outstanding, services are prompt and prices are great; every thing is just where it needs to be.  Each dish may not score a ten but they're all at least an eight or a nine.  Some dish, like meatball with vegetable is a clear ten.  It's a restaurant I'd go back to time after time.
4 There are a lot of decent places to eat in Chinatown. You can eat in a different place every day and that's exactly what we did for 3 straight nights.  Shanghai Asia Minor was our favorite. The combination of food, service, seating and wait time was the best in that Mott street neighborhood. Local residents backed up our point of view.   We had Chicken corn soup, shrimp dumplings, beef lo mein, and shrimp/chicken with hoisin sauce. All were excellent, the price was very reasonable and the experience was great.
5 By far one of my favorite places to eat in the city! I swear I've brought so many people here not only for the soup dumplings, but for pretty much everything on the menu.  The xiao long bao here beats the ones I've had at din Tai Fung in Taipei, or any other XLB I've had elsewhere. Perfectly thin wrapped and consistently delicious soup on the inside. This stuff is crack. I'll definitely eat this at my deathbed.  Other favorites include the rice cake noodles, the szechuan wontons, and eggplant with garlic sauce.
3 Nah...soup dumplings bland and so so texture and taste. I still like Joe's better. Couldn't leave this review because it was toooo short soooo hoping this beautiful sentence is enough to post a review...there!
5 Amazing food and service. We had the pork and crab dumplings (best xia long bao I havr ever had), szechuan style dumplings, pork potstickers and the spare ribs. The szechuan dumplings were cooked to perfection and the chilli oil they were soaked in was great. The potstickers were a bit oily but still good. The spare ribs just fell of the bone and the sauce was very good. The crown jewel were the pork and crab dumplings, the soup and filling were absolutely amazing, best I have ever had. Best part was the waiter showing me how to eat them as to not burn my mouth. Portions were very big and prices are fair.
4 This place had a 5 star rating from me before I went back the second time.  The first experience here was great. I went with a group of friends and enjoyed a fantastic meal at such an affordable price. The chili oil and wontons are so so good and almost everything I had that day I loved. The black truffle soup dumplings are so worth the extra bucks. If you haven't had them before, they are a treat, but you couldn't eat too many of them. It is great to try and experience.  The soup dumplings in general are great and the skin around the dumpling is perfectly thin and delicious.   The second time I came here I was so excited to have another great meal, but it was lackluster at best.   I got the regular beef noddle soup thinking it would be similar to the first one I got, but I think the waitress messed order up. My friend got the beef and broccoli and there was just no flavor there.   I am going to try this place again and hope they just had an off day.
4 Absolutely delicious! They have the best xiao long bo in the city. Crab or pork, you can't go wrong. Wait times have gotten a lot worse since tourist have found this to be head and shoulders better than the tourist-trap down the block. The stir fry udon and rice cakes, meatballs, shredded chicken and scallion pan cakes are among my favorites here. They only take cash or Amex (No MC, Visa or Discover).
5 Love this place,  come with co-workers. It's great, clean and fast service. Price is amazing.
5 Whenever I visit New York or California, I am always excited about two things : delicious, greasy Chinese food and being in dim sum heaven.   Shanghai Asian manor is located within the heart of Chinatown, New York. I love their fast-pace service and it's understandable as to why their service is quick; they get extremely busy.   The significant other and I avoided a long wait due to the restaurant having only two seats open upon us entering the establishment. We shared soup dumplings, scallion pancakes, and general tso's chicken. All were very good, but we were both very impressed by their soup dumplings!!  Also, the business only accepts cash and American Express. I believe that they just started implementing this action, because they had signs posted all over the restaurant stating that they had change their form of payment on September 1.   Don't worry, there's an ATM a block down from them.
4 Solid meal! We stuck with the smaller dishes / dim sum... Szechwan wontons were really enjoyable with a nice texture and good sauce, shrimp/pea shoot dumplings were light and juicy, crab/pork soup dumplings were nice and crabby - good, but enjoyed the other dishes more. Then we added on baby bok choy for some green and crunch. Enjoyable meal, would definitely be back!
5 Highly: pork and crab XL, Shanghai Lo Mein with shrimp and mixed meat and the scallion pancake. All so good. Service is pretty fast and friendly; they don't rush you out especially since there's always a wait. I've been there twice and I've waited 30-40 mins both times.
5 the best xiao long bao around. A lot of people love the crab and pork, but I like the regular pork more as it's not the best quality crab on earth. best of all are the truffle ones, which cost 2x as much, but they're made with real truffles and taste at least 2x as good. Every time I've been here, no matter how many people are outside, the quoted wait time is 20 or 30 minutes. Worth it at almost any wait. Cash or AMEX only.
4 It's good but cash and Amex only (seriously why???)!! We've gone less Bc all of Europe and other restaurants don't accept Amex so we cancelled the card. We don't always carry cash for safety.
5 Absolutely delicious! Probably one of my favorite meals in New York.  Pork soup dumplings aren't the best I've had in my life, but easily better than the hyped Joe's Shanghai. I think this place has a cleaner and less fatty taste than Joe's, which I prefer.   The truffle dumplings are a must for first timers! I don't like them more than pork, but I think they're worth trying. They're very rich, and 2 dumplings were enough for me.  Szechuan wontons were my absolute favorite dish we ordered. I also enjoyed the spicy beed noodle soup and the zhajiangmian. They do noodles right!  Service was also notably good! Very rare for Asian restaurants.   Cannot wait to visit again. This restaurant is probably at the top of my list. Eeek, that's saying a lot!
5 Fantastic dim sum spot in the heart of Chinatown - an area I wouldn't normally venture to, but this place is absolutely worth the trek.   Cash only, casual and authentic, Shanghai Asian Manor offers up seriously delicious small plates enjoyed by the locals.   Standouts include the soup dumplings, spicy Szechuan wonton, and pork buns. Skip out on the noodle dishes - grease logged, piled high and easily outshined by the smaller dishes.   Can't wait to return!
5 Where do I even begin???! This place is BOMB! I don't always venture into Chinatown, but my roommate and I have been coming lately to check out all the hot spots for soup dumplings. Of course we tried Joe's Shanghai, but I am going to be completely honest, and I think Shanghai Asian Manor has the BEST soup dumplings I've had so far!! They rarely break when you pick them up and are filled with a good amount of soup.  I've also tried the chicken lo mein (substituting the normal noodles with udon) - A MUST! I've also had the seaseme chicken and crispy beef as entrees, and as you'd expect, they are also amazing.  I recommend this place and have taken so many visitors here - it's that good!
5 Awesome spot for soup dumplings while you are stuck on jury duty. I made the mistake of ordering a side of chicken fried rice just for me as a side to my pork soup dumplings. Don't get me wrong, the fried rice was great, it was just enough fried rice to feed each juror, only I was eating it by myself. The service was great and the place was pretty nice inside. I'd definitely recommend it if you are in the area and are looking for some solid soup dumplings.
5 first time to NY, and we yelped for some dim sum to walk to from brooklyn bridge.  we made it just before lunch time on a saturday and were seated right away.  when we left, there were groups outside waiting for tables.    we only ordered three items from their dim sum menu (shrimp dumplings,steamed tiny buns w/ pork, and pan-fried wontons).  between two girls on an adventure, it was just enough for both of us to finish.  everything was deliciously amazing!  thanks for the great food and service.
4 I read great reviews for this place on Yelp, so I figured it wouldn't hurt to swing by before leaving to the airport to go home. We came on a Sunday afternoon and the wait was only 20 minutes (surprisingly), I don't even think we waited the entire 20 minutes, we were seated much quicker than we'd anticipated. This was a clean and spacious little gem in Chinatown, service was not terrible either. My husband and I shared the crab and pork soup dumplings, the shrimp and chive dumplings (the wrapper was green!), and the Szechuan wontons. We went to Joe's Shanghai last time and it didn't live up to the hype. However, my husband loved the crab and pork soup dumplings at Shanghai Asian Manor, but my favorite were the Szechuan style wontons - the sauce is to die for! Super delicious and well worth the trouble getting to Chinatown to have a taste.
2 I was satisfied as I normally am when eating dim sum in chinatown. However this place did not have the 4star rating that led me here.  We started off by ordered Thai iced tea. Not such a great choice. Took two sips and stopped drinking. Started off with the scallion pancake which was delicious. Dumplings were pretty good. However the pork buns were not great at all. The meat felt as if it were microwaved.   Compared to my previous experience at other dim sum places I think this was the worst. I will 100% not be back here.  They only take cash or Amex and is about a 30 min wait to eat. With plenty of other options I will just choose a different one.
4 This place has really good soup dumplings.  The soup is not overly oily or fatty and has a hint of sweetness to it that really finishes well.  Other places seem to have too much bite to the soup in the ginger or vinegar but the balance of flavors makes these one of the better soup dumplings we have experienced.  The other dishes are solid from the noodle soups to the rice.
5 What! As a lover of soup dumplings I would recommend Shanghai Asian Manor a million times over. Dumplings were on point. Juicy, savory, sauce was mmm. Also shared scallion pancakes, also so good, and eggplant in garlic sauce - so good. They are cash or Amex only. They have 1 beer available, which was perfect w the pancakes. Would recommend and return here again.
4 Giving 5 stars means it's perfect. 5/5 for the food. The atmosphere is the only negative, it's always crowded and the wait is ridiculous. Going at lunch time (12pm) is the best cause you can beat the crowd.
3 Food is decent and the quality is better than most places in China town. But my problem is that flavor, most of them taste very bland.
4 Try the truffle soup dumpling! It's awesome ! The crab & pork ones are good as well. Fast service. No big complaints besides only being able to take AMEX. Clean & bigger restroom then most Chinatown restaurants.
5 I have to come here every time I am in NYC! It is one of those place that the food is so good I remember and wanting to come back to NYC just to have another meals here!  I love the chili sauce wonton, and any of those dumplings were super delicious!
4 Description: Michelin Star Sichuan Cuisine  Service: They are very nice. The food is delivered extremely quickly and they are quick to notice if you run out of water   Atmosphere: It is quite loud inside. The tables are seated close to each other. It is cozily, dimly lit. There is a nice bar area   Items Tasted - Dan dan noodles: This has an oily, peanut buttery taste. The noodles are cooked well  - Chungking spicy chicken: This is good and slightly spicy - Braised fish filet with tofu: This was my favorite dish. It was done well and didn't make me feel like I was slurping oil  Recommendation: I'd only recommend this place to someone looking for a nicer Chinese restaurant for both the food and atmosphere rather than to someone who purely wants to eat Sichuan food. The food here is good, but can easily be found in Chinatown for a cheaper price and a larger portion size
4 The service was excellent: very efficient, no overly friendly waiters that make you feel obliged to converse, food comes out super fast - everything you look for in a midtown restaurant. There was no bad dish. Had to order their famous cold noodles. We liked the sauce, BUT there were a few strands of noodles (not the entire noodle strand but part of it) that were DRY - like, they've been sitting out for long, and there are parts of the noodles that weren't coated in sauce which then dried out. Really?! Is it a dish that is not good there, so people don't order it often? Or just a bad day? In any case, I bet the Michelin judges were served better ones haha, unless they really like the texture of dried out noodles ;)
5 I don't know if the place is Michelin star worthy but the food is excellent. The scallion pancakes are simply amazing, as was the cold chicken dish.  The waiters kept our glasses full at all times.  The wait was only 15 minutes on a weeknight.  We plan to come again and try more dishes.
5 I'll literally say this is the best Sichuan food I've ever had in nyc. The taste was so authentic!!
4 Three pepper dish was perfect spiciness!Go to four at your own risk.  The dumplings, three pepper chicken and spicy fish were each a refined dish.
4 Excellent service upon entry to exit. Food was fantastic & authentic. We tried a wide variety. It was great. And although I love duck the duck fried rice was not fav. I was a tad disappointed as I was very excited to try it. Still great food.  Loved the environment, decor, & play list. Ps. Its not a cash only business.
1 Ordered Cafe China delivery today. The Dan Dan noodles I ordered came with zero sauce. As you can see in the picture, it was just plain, dry noodles with some specks of meat. I tried to call to get a refund or an exchange three times - no one picked up the phone... and it's 6:45PM.  Extremely disappointed, won't be ordering take out again.
3 Full house by 11:35am on a Saturday.    Staff/friends were eating food and drinking beverage from outside at the bar.  Not Michelin worthy, in my opinion.
1 Their food is so so, their service is the worst I've ever had. The server won't let us go unless we tip more than 15%.  （and their service is soooooo bad) If you got one star of Michelin, you should work hard to keep it, otherwise you will end up with one star on google&yelp review.
1 It's not worth the 1.30 hours waiting! The staffs of this place have the worst service, manner and attitude ever! One staff called us back because he doesn't satisfy with the tips! (Which we paid 15% of the price before including tax) He literally use a calculator in front of my friend and ask us to come back to give them more tips! I won't go back to this place and wouldn't recommend any of my friends to go there as well! Such a bad experience!
1 The food is fine. But definitely not that great if comparing with China Blue or Birds Of A Feather. And it's absolutely not worth more than 30 mins wait. (I wait for 1.5 hours) Most importantly, the staffs are super rude that they called us back and literally showed us the check and said we didn't tip enough. (Which we did) Cafe China has the worst attitude as a restaurant in New York I've ever been. Everyone PLEASE DON'T GO. They don't deserve you any penny. Feel sad to everyone works there, cause apparently, no one taught them manners ever. WORSE THAN ONE STAR!  (Added on 10/22 after China Blue replied the comment) Hi Xian, People add tips based on their experience of the service, place, and food. And paying tips before tax is just a common sense. We definitely did pay enough tips ( it was more than $6, 15% pre-tax) We can literally pay NOTHING for your service. The tips we paid was definitely ONLY for food. There is no rule saying that anyone should pay how many percentages if you had such a bad experience. Your suggested tips were overrated yourself (and it was post-tip). Btw, before you replied the comment, you really should spend some time with your staffs and make sure they don't lie about things especially how they treat the customers. Thanks.
4 Came here for takeout last Sunday for the first time, ordered 3 dishes (fish with silken tofu, Chung King spicy chicken, A choy), and it was ready within 5 minutes - the fastest take out service I've ever had! Each of the dishes were delicious and like true Szechuan dishes, spicy and flavorful. My only complaint was the ratio of peppers to chicken in the Chicken dish, it was pretty awful. I visit NY once a year and will definitely come back. And, it's a One Michelin star rated Chinese restaurant!
2 Service downright surly, if you could even find waiter he was unpleasant.  Food: Chicken soup - a flavor that was very strange to me, possibly it was supposed to be, same to be said for preparation of the chicken in it, it looked more like a black mushroom slice with a crunch that was a bone. Kung Pao chicken - very ordinary.  Dumplings and Greenbeans both quite good.  I am OK with having a meal that I don't love, even service that is slow, but waiters that don't look at you or even wait for you to finish ordering before they run off are not OK.
3 Cafe China is one of those restaurants where the food is great and the service is not. It definitely deserves its Michelin star - stars only consider food. But almost every time I've dealt with their service - dozens of times - I've been disappointed. From surly hosts to long waits to forgotten orders, the back of house easily outshines the front. It would not take much for CC to be great. For now, delivery is a much better bet than dining in.
5 This place doesnt fail to disappoint, at this point i have tried bunch of different dishes. I always come with my co workers n we do family style. All the meats come out perfectly cooked, veggies are perfect, wallets are not broke, what else do we want. I always make reservations.
1 Food is good. Service was extremely rude, as they complained about the tip amount before we left the restaurant. Tip amount was more than appropriate. Just noticed on our credit card statement that they overcharged by $100.
5 This is one of the best Chinese meal I had after I come to the U.S. I love the food, the Lazi Chicken is highly recommended. The boiled fish as well.
5 I love this place! Depending on when you try and go, it can be a bit of a wait, but I always think it's worth it. I definitely recommend going with a few people so you can try more dishes. I usually end up over ordering because I always want too many!
5 Lunch was so good I feel like I should go back and subtract a star from all the other Chinese places I've reviewed. We decided to grab lunch here because it was close to our bus stop and I remembered seeing it on a list of NYTimes food picks. It's dark and intimate, even in the middle of the day. It was about noon on Saturday but there was no wait.  We ordered beef with tea tree mushrooms and fish filet with tofu. Both were rated two pepper symbols, and they were pleasantly spicy. The fish was well made and typical for Szechuan, smooth and nutty with some mouth numbing spice. The beef dish was amazing though. Very flavorful with lots of great texture. We didn't know Cafe China had a Michelin Star, it sure doesn't look like it, but the beef dish definitely made me believe it!
4 I've been here multiple times, and have never been disappointed! Cafe China offers classic dishes that are all equally flavorful and exciting. I will say that the portion sizes are definitely on the smaller-to-medium side. I would highly recommend coming here with more than 2 people, and to order a couple dishes and to share everything family-style so that you can try multiple things!  Things that stand out: In appetizers: Definitely the Jellyfish Scallion Pesto and the Mouth-Watering Chicken.  For entrees: Any of their fish dishes are always a hit and you can't go wrong (especially their fragrant fish filet, or their steamed fish). They also have a duck-fried rice thats really good and so is their Kung-Pao Chicken.
5 A relatively affordable, one star Michelin place is always a good find, and this seems to be cafe China's main pull. I think this puts an unfair bar to meet for the restaurant, but I'm happy to say cafe china meets this bar for it's customers, which explains the lines that form most weekdays. The food seems to remain true to it's roots and not too "Americanized", and the price for the lunch menu is excellent for the quality of food you get. I like to come here for small team lunches, as everyone seems to be impressed with the food and small groups get seated relatively quickly. In this particular instance, I ordered the wonton soup and the braised fish stew.  Wonton soup: the wontons were meaty and filled with a good amount of filling. Made for a good appetizer.  Chungking braised fish stew: I got the spicy red style, and this might be my favorite Szechuan dish I've ever had. True to the cuisine style, the soup left my lips tingling and numb without being too spicy, and it looked like they added two whole fish in the bowl. Spicy, delicious and refreshing, I would recommend this dish to anyone who likes spicy food.
1 Not impressed. Came here because the reviews were good but we found the opposite.the spring rolls were served room temperature almost cold. I asked if they're supposed to be that way and the waiter said they are supposed to be warm, not hot. They did offer to replace them, we declined. I ordered the Kung Pao chicken and it tasted extremely sour. My husband ordered the ribs and he likes them but I thought they lacked in flavor. Again, very disappointed. But there must be people who like their food this way because it has other people who give it great reviews. Just not my cup of tea I guess.
5 Hands down my favorite Chinese Food in NYC.  The Red Pepper Chicken is amazing and is just the right amount of heat. Order ahead on Yelp and take it to go.  I also like to get an extra serving of rice and save half of the meal for the next day for lunch. Great place for any business person saying in midtown.
3 We came here for an early lunch and my expectations were high due to reviews and Michelin star. I liked the old fashion decor, it added to the authenticity of the place. We decided to start off with the pork dumplings, bok choy, and cold noodles with chili sauce. The cold noodles were so delicious! The chili sauce was flavorful and just the right amount of spicy. This was my favorite dish, would definitely go back and order this again. We then had the bok choy which was very underwhelming and lacked any flavor. The dumplings were just ok. I ordered the fillet of fish with mushrooms and was confused once my dish arrived. I was expecting a fish fillet but the presentation was just a big bowl of fish with a few mushrooms. It just didn't look very appetizing, the actual taste was not much better. I had a few bites and just decided that it was best to eat plain rice. The portions here are huge, none of us were able to finish our meals. Besides the cold noodles, the food did not live up to the hype.
5 Awesome. Great flavor. Fast service. Large portions. Spicy dishes are actually spicy. Veggie dishes have lots of flavor. Chicken dishes have lots of meat. I would most certainly be back!
5 Is this place busy? Absolutely. Is the food here good? No, it's amazing.   I've never waited to get in because I know the wait can be ridiculous and they no longer take reservations for small parties. So we've always come here at an odd hour (think 4pm on a Sunday afternoon). I've probably sampled enough dishes here during all my past visits, but here are some of my favorites:  - Pork in Garlic Dressing: thinly sliced steamed pork was tender and juicy, mixed in garlicy soy dressing. It was simple and delicate.  - Pickle fish stew: tender fish in white broth with pickled cabbage. When we visited Chengdu couple of years ago, we had a very similar dish and my husband was in love with it. We've been searching for something like that here in Manhattan, and this one does not disappoint.  - Braised fish filet with tofu. Most Sichuan restaurant serve some variation of this dish. Here they do it right. Fish is tender, and soaks up all the flavors in the spicy chili sauce.  - Eggplant Sichuan style: this one is both my and my husband's all time favorite here. It's steamed eggplant, mixed in this amazing sauce that has spiciness, saltiness, sourness from pickles, and sweetness. Those four flavors are essentially the undertone for all Sichuan food (per our food tour in Chengdu), and the way you mix it will determine the flavors that come out in different dishes. This eggplant dish is the like the gold child of the mixes.   Anyways, good luck scoring a table here, and when you do, I hope you enjoy the food as much as I do.   P.s., we've been to a lot of restaurants in Manhattan with our baby since she was born, this is the very first place that does not have a high chair or booster seat. Maybe it's their way to deter people from bringing babies here, but hey, babies need  to develop their palates!
5 What a wonderful surprise in midtown. Skip the line take the communal table.  Ordered the shredded beef w tea tree mushrooms, braised pork Szechuan style, crystal shrimp dumplings and pork dumplings in chili oil.
4 TL;DR: good place to go to if you want an affordable meal after which you can pretend you're fancy and say you've had a Michelin star meal.  *** FOOD *** Seems to me like a hit or miss situation. We ordered the dan dan noodles, eggplant, bok choi, and spicy beef. I think all of these were great but the stars were definitely the veggies. Definitely recommend coming here for a delicious, greasy, spicy vegetarian meal.  *** DRINKS *** Pretty standard  *** AMBIANCE *** Clutter chic
5 Perfection! I loved everything that I ate. Even my mother, who is a picky eater, was impressed with the food! The Dan Dan noodles were an instant hit, along with the dim sum, and sautéed lobster. The quality of the food absolutely exceeded my expectations. Whenever I visit New York, this place will always be on my "Must Do" list.
5 Stumbled upon this place on our last day in NYC. We wanted Chinese but didnt feel like catching the subway to Chinatown. Saw this place had a Michelin star and in Manhattan. Got there and knew we were in for a treat. There was a 30-45 minute wait but thank goodness I made a rsvp before leaving the hotel. The restaurant has a cute cluttered decor. My husband and I got sat at the first table of a long wall of folks dining. Staff has to pull the table out so one person can squeeze in to sit against the wall. Your basically sitting next to the next person, smelling their food, and close enough to partake in their conversation. We ordered the Dan Dan noodles, cumin spicy lamb, dumplings, honey walnut shrimp, another dish I forgot but was recommended, and my husband slipped in an order of kung pao chicken. I had to admit his choice was the best order. It had a lot of flavor you want from a chinese restaurant. So damn good. Oh and dishes were the cutest.
1 There are many bad restaurants with ridiculous customer services in the city. And out of all those bad restaurants, I'm sure Cafe China is ranked number 1. So congratulations for being the worst customer service and keep treating your customer the worst! I'm sure you will get worse and worse every time with the attitude of disrespect.  To be honest I totally think Cafe China lower the standard of Chinese food in United States. And I feel sorry for all other Chinese food just because the existence of cafe china.
5 This place has great food.  We've done delivery and also eaten in person.  The wait time to dine in is pretty dreadful, and sometimes they won't deliver to us because we live on the east side of 2nd Ave (people literally across the street can order, but not us!).  Even with those difficulties, this place is worth it - fair prices for great, spicy food.  I love both of their eggplant preparations and the chungking chicken is easily one of the best , most authentic dishes (we've had the same meal in Hong Kong, its a little spicier there, but they also don't remove the bones...).
3 I went here during lunchtime on a weekday. It was packed but my co-worker and I were promptly seated. I ordered a spicy fish dish with white rice and spring rolls. All in all the food was pretty good. They did not skimp on the spice in my fish's sauce. The price point and portion sizes are both very reasonable considering the location. Although it was packed the servers did check on us several times. Give this place a shot!
2 Based on the effusive reviews of the NY Times and others, I decided to eat here after a business meeting in the area.  I ordered one of their "mid-fall specials" listed on an insert in their menu - The "shrimp with crab oil".  The waiter explained how these shrimp are deep fried with a breading and then prepared in a wok with "crab essence".  For $27, it was nothing more than fried shrimp with their shells with absolutely no flavor, or heat.   Difficult to separate the shell from the meat I had to content myself with a mouthful of shrimp shell with each bite. An appetizer of marinated cucumber was tasty, not worth the $7 for a bowl of pickles.   Over-priced, over-hyped, filled with 20-somethings with a lot of extraneous income who are more enamored of each other than they are of good food.
5 One of the best chinese food experiences I have ever had. Get a bunch of dishes and share with 5-6 friends. Cumin lamb was delicious. All dumplings were great. Great noodles.
4 It was my first time trying cafe china, I like it! The food was decent service was great! We had spicy boiling fish, dan dan noodle, beef tendons and a vegetable dish, I will say everything was pretty good and authentic, we will go back again if there's no line there!
5 Fantastic food,great portions,beautiful decor,great cocktails,amazing service! What else could you want! This is owned by the same team behind cafe China (minus the lines). give them a try and you won't regret it.
2 DIM SUM review only: I finally had the chance to try their dim sum on a Saturday morning. On the plus side, there was no wait to be seated at 11:30 and the dishes came out pretty quickly. Downside is that for dim sum, each offering is fairly pricey and large, so I only tried two. Soup Dumplings, though on the menu, are no longer offered. I did have the Crystal Shrimp Dumplings, a/k/a har gow (6 for $10). The dumpling skins were too thick, resulting in an overly doughy bite. The shrimp themselves were the same you would find in Manhattan Chinatown - I was expecting better, frankly, given the general quality of this restaurant, but they were nothing special. I also had the Spicy Chengdu Wontons (8 for $8). They came bathed in a very spicy oil sauce, served in a bowl with a spoon. I suggest ditching the spoon and using chop sticks given the composition of the sauce. Although pleasingly spicy, the wontons were ultimately ruined by a cloying sweetness that was really out of place and annoying. I don't recommend this dish. All in all, I'd not return for dim sum. Note, however, that their lunch is an awesome bargain!
4 Super delicious! We sat at the bar briefly waiting on a table. Had a great drink from their specialty drink menu. The bartender was awesome, friendly and great to watch his mixology skills at work. Our table of 4 on a Saturday evening was a 10 minute wait although it seems we got in early enough to avoid the line out the door. Also be aware there is only 1 bathroom available so plan accordingly.  Now down to the food. We ordered dumplings in chili sauce, and the pancake to start. So yummy we ordered round 2 of the same. We then shared the garlic eggplant, double fried pork belly and the duck . Everything was super good. It was hard to know who our waiter was because several people came by throughout the meal but really good attentive service. Already planning my next visit to NYC and will definitely make a stop at Cafe China.
5 Amazing Chinese food (authentic style) near 5th Ave. Our friend invited us here during our trip to NYC. It's super convenient when we just visited the city library, and shopped around the area. I would recommend almost everything on the menu, but here's something I ordered and they tasted so good: Spicy Diced Rabbit (if you are not against it) Beef sauteed with pickled chili chungking spicy chicken  The only down side for this place is that the AC isn't strong enough during the hot days. It's acceptable but could be better.
5 The food here is really great. I saw a champagne on the menu and thinking it's one of the Americanized Chinese but it turned out really good.  I recommend to go with few of your friends and share the plate.  Spicy dish is good but spicy!  Order spicy and non spicy ones and share the plate
4 Delicious food and good (quite fast) service. Lots of spices under the spiciness, flavors are complex and surprising. Decor is reminiscent of a colonial era. Ambient music however is totally unrelated and takes away from the nice atmosphere. It's also a bit loud as diners have to scream over it.
5 Pleasant surprise - order all the smaller dishes (dan dan noodles were very good and authentic)
3 If not for the Michelin decals on the entryway door, it would be easy to pass by Cafe China just as any other neighborhood Chinese joint. The place is very unassuming but pleasant in all respects: ambiance, service, decor, presentation. The space is designed around to evoke the sensibilities of Shanghai in the 1930s. It is very casual, comfortable and approachable, a far cry from most Michelin venues. Good place for a casual meal.  My understanding is that the wait times can be rather lengthy. Reservations are available, but only for parties of 4+ (make that parties of 8+ for the 6pm to 9pm time slots). As we happened to be in the neighborhood Sunday afternoon, we took our chances for a late lunch, walking in no problem around 2pm.  In terms of food, we tried: - Pork Pot Stickers ($8): Nothing special really, but they were tasty nonetheless. - Dan Dan Noodles ($7): Just a hint of spice, quite well done with classic flavors. Recommend. - Pork Dumplings in Chili Oil ($9): A favorite in general and this was no exception, the skins were not too thick and chili oil that left a lingering heat but not a severe burn. Loved it! - Spicy Cumin Lamb ($23): Enjoyed, but would have liked more fresh cilantro for freshness. It got a bit heavy. - Kung Pao Chicken ($15): Pretty standard, the sauce was not my favorite of the type but overall still decent. Bok Choy with Garlic ($13): Cooked perfectly with perceptible, but not overly dominant, garlic flavor. Recommend.  Our experience was solid, though nothing exceptional. The award of a Michelin star is slightly curious. Would return to try more dishes, but only at times where no significant wait is required.
4 Forget about not having to wait at this authentic , home style delicious Chinese spot. Be sure to make a reservation as restaurant is always crowded. The food has mostly been very tasty. We always have the chili oil dumplings to start off our meal, but this last time, they were not smooth, very hard. Perhaps with the crowd they had to pre cook so it was disappointing.  Smoked tea duck was delicious. Their vegetables always come out lovely fresh and green. Kung Pao chicken which I only ordered for my American friends' sake was delicious than many restaurants. I was even impressed with tilapia cooked with a sweet and sour sauce ( I normally never eat tilapia) . Perhaps they could have better fish selection. Lamb had the right amount of spice and the Sichuan peppercorns made the tongue tingle. The fried sweet potato pancakes was an interesting dish. I didn't think it would be tasty, but it was. This place is never a good place for a Romantic date! It's the noisiest restaurant Ive ever been to, but just going for the food is well worth it.
4 We were ten of us and we went here for friend's birthday.  The food we ordered were amazing and the service was good. The only reason I took one star away because they have only one bathroom.  We tried varieties of food like shrimp, rice, string beans, duck, chicken, pork and a huge  and they were amazing. I loved the red pepper in the shrimp dish.. the peppers were big and crunchy with some peanuts. Another dish was the fish- simple, steamed and yumm.  The only thing I didn't like was firstly, they need at least 2 restrooms. Secondly, they need to play better music or not play anything cuz that thing was so loud that's why everyone was loud and we couldn't even have a normal conversation in normal tone even if we were sitting next to each other so close.
5 The wife and I came to Cafe China on a Saturday night. The wait was 15 minutes and I think, totally worth it!  We started with the following cold dishes: pickled vegetables, a order of the Dan Dan noodles, and pork belly. The pickled vegetables had a nice mix of richness from the oil with a note of heat and earthiness;almost nutty. Not to mention a slight tang of vinegar. Good start to the meal.   The Dan Dan noodles has nice firmness, that soaked up the sauce, which had a similar mix of heat and earthiness from the pickled veggie dish but slightly cranked up. Cafe China was on a roll.   Then we had the steamed pork dumpling dim sum in a dark sauce that had the trifecta of heat, tang, and richness. I expected a typical dumpling starter, but it just tasted little better than usual.  The cold pork belly dish came with cucumbers in a dark soy sauce that was not as rich but balanced well with the thin sliced pork. The cucumber had some nice tang to them as well. This was an ok starter.  Now for the entrees. We ordered the Chunking Spicy chicken, Bok Choy with Garlic, and Eggplant in garlic sauce.   The standout is the Chungking chicken, which had crispy chicken with lots of red chili peppers. It is a spicy dish, but the spiciness was not overwhelming. It was a steady but manageable level of heat that actually complemented the salt in the crispy chicken. It's the refreshing kind of heat - not the painful, sweat inducing type.   The bok Choy is something my wife and I usually order from Chinese restaurants. The bok Choy was soft but still had a slight snap to when you took a bite. Good flavor and execution here.  The eggplant came piping hot, in a temperature way, not very spicy. This is also one of our usuals and Cafe China followed through (again) with good flavor and execution. The eggplant was soft but held its shape well when you picked it up with the chop sticks. The sauce was thick and appropriately sweet. It was a nice partner to the heat from the Chungking chicken.  For dessert, my wife had a ginger gelato that I managed to sample. It had a nice ginger flavor that was not too strong, nor too sweet. The texture is more ice cream rather than gelato, but it still tasted good.  The restaurant itself has a cool antique vibe, with old school Chinese posters on the wall and modest, but classic looking chandeliers hanging above a few of the tables. The staff was on point, very polite and attentive. So is it the best ever Chinese restaurant? I wouldn't go that far, but Cafe China definitely fulfills it's one-star Michelin rating by being a restaurant with excellent cooking and worth a stop.
1 Service is good but the food is not good at all... their spices are over powering. Even after sending the food back to less power the cumin, it was same... just didn't like it at all... waste of money.
4 Its a bit pricey which is understandable since it has a michelin star. The meal was good, stuff was nice!
4 Pork wanton dumpling    Pork dumplings  3 pepper chicken  Duck fried rice  We enjoyed it all Next time, sake!  Like it a lot! Service was slow, BUT not unbearable. Second waiter was more attentive-guess they switched us I'd recommend you try this joint!
4 nice food , good service, place is OK , I do not know however how they got their One star Michelin, I guess it is like Porsche making SUVs, every body  will want one and will cheapen the brand's image. we tried spicy cumin lamb, mapo tofu, Dan Dan Noodles,  scallion pancakes and double pork all were up to par, with scallion pancake,  pan fried pork dumplings a standout. ordered a Vietnamese coffee which was good.
1 My experience here was terrible. My girlfriend was nice enough to pay for our meal that night and she tipped 15%, which honestly isn't that low for the quality of service + the food but once we left the restaurant and walked all the way down the block, a waiter came chasing after us asking us if the service was bad and about the quality of food. The food is pretty bad for the price, and I'm talking compared to cheaper Sichuan Chinese Restaurants. I could cook up a better Sichuan meal any day. However, my girlfriend was nice to respond that both were OK. I should've said something then when she took out ONE MORE DOLLAR but I suppose the waiter is just trying to get by. The food might not be the waiter's fault but this was also the same waiter that was rude to us in he restaurant.   That being said, clearly this restaurant needs to treat their employees better considering the amount of money they take for the quality of food.
3 Considering the hype about this place, I was not terribly impressed. Two friends and I easily got a booth at around 5:45 PM on a weeknight, but it took forever for a waiter to come and take our order.   We shared the Dan Dan Noodles, spicy cumin lamb, mapo tofu, scallion pancakes and vegetable potstickers. I think Han Dynasty's dan dan noodles are better, as is Mission Chinese's mapo tofu. I will say the spicy cumin lamb was the best I've ever had, and by far the tastiest thing we ate here. The scallion pancake was also a standout.   Unfortunately, the other dishes weren't particularly memorable. 3.5 stars.
5 I'm visiting from the San Francisco Bay Area, and this is my first time in New York. This is probably the best Chinese restaurant I've ever been to. Food is AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS and customer service is outstanding ! They're very vigilant and have great hospitality. Thank you for giving me a great experience !
3 I get that Yelpers like it here but 5 stars?  Come on.  Also was there a typo on the Michelin guide that this place got 1 star?  In the same category as Gabriel Kreuther, Gotham Bar and Grill and many other well deserving NYC restaurants?  PLEASE do not eat here if you have Michelin expectatons.  If, on the other hand you want to eat in a restaurant with good food, bare decor and unfriendly service please do come.   We went for lunch on a Monday.  Sat immediately at 12:30.  Had the baby cucumbers, ma po tofu with chili sauce lunch special and string beans lunch. Lunches come with a choice of hot and sour soup or a spring roll. We had one each.   All of the food was good.  A bit too oily and greasy but the bowl of rice absorbed some of it.  This is a nice neighborhood place.   Definitely not a 5 star yelp or 1 Michelan rating.
5 Love the place , the decoration  is really nice and warm , feeling a real authentic Shanghai cafe. The food was amazing , fresh and delicious. Make sure you get there around 12:15 or after 2 , since it's crazy busy in between that time frame
5 I had the picked fish stew. The soup and fish is so delicious. I really want to come back in a few weeks. The wait for dinner on a tuesday night is like 30-40 mins.   It is totally worthy to wait.   I also order the mushroom dish. It is nothing special, just taste really bland. But the fish stew is A+ plus.
5 So good! The service was impeccable. The wine list was great. The pork dumplings and bang bang chicken were to die for. Everything was amazing. can't wait to return
3 Going back a bit to our obsession with Asian cuisine, we decided to roll the dice on this seemingly buzzed about spot in Yellpland.  All that comes to mind about this place is "What?!!" I don't get it. It's not extraordinary by any means.   First impression: It's lovely. The front of the restaurant is quaint, nicely lit and inviting. That said, we got to sit at the last table in the front section, directly in front of the area that the staff go in and out of the kitchen, which was not all that bad, except we got to spend the meal watching about a half dozen waiters just spinning around in what seemed like totally confusion. And, there is nothing particularly charming or inviting about the back section, except that it's close to the restroom.   I was very underwhelmed and unimpressed with the food.   Jayson had an order of dumplings and the shrimp shumai. He enjoyed them both, and really, that is a true test. Though those aren't exactly the most complicated of meals.   I had the clear soup with meatballs to start. Eh. It was clear soup with meatballs. Not a lot of flavor. It required doctoring with soy sauce and more.   I then had the bok choy in garlic sauce. It was okay. But, it took forever to get. We were already done with everything. In fact, we even asked if we just not get it since it hadn't come out in almost 30 minutes, which was odd since they are one of those places that literally brings your food out in minutes, not together like a meal, but whenever it's ready, which is so irritating.   But, anyway, after waiting a half hour, and the dish still not there, we asked the waiter to please just cancel it. He went back in the kitchen, came out 7 minutes later and said, "I'm sorry, it's already halfway cooked," which was beyond annoying since it was clear that they had forgotten about it.   I don't really have any complaints about the food. It just lacks any kind of wow factor that would warrant such excitement and buzz. It was eh.  Would I go back, definitely not. But, would I discourage other, no.   It's okay and certainly suitable for people looking for a quick in and out meal.
4 Authentic chinese restaurant with a good variety of dishes on the menu. The food is however a bit on the oily side.
3 I went there last Friday evening around 7pm-ish. There was a wait and the hostess was incredibly rude. Please be more thorough when you hire the person who first represents your restaurant! She clearly was annoyed with customers.
4 My favorite Chinese spot in NYC also happens to be one of the busiest Chinese food joints, so I had to wait 45min to be seated for dinner on a Monday. But the wait was well worth it. My date and I ended up walking around a few blocks and built up a ravenous appetite. We ordered:   * Shredded Beef with Green Chili * Chungking Spicy Chicken  The food was very flavorful and enjoyable. My only complaint, and the reason I gave Cafe China 4/5, was because the shredded beef with green chili's came in a small bowl and had more green chili's than beef. While the beef was delicious, it was disappointing to not have enough of it. Other than this, the experience of going to Cafe China was well worth the 45 min wait.   This spot is great for:  * Dates * Dinner with friends/strangers/yourself * Lunch with friends/strangers/yourself
5 Nice decoration bring me back to 1930s Shanghai. The appetizer has two "You must have" things. First is Dan Dan noodle because I like the sauces and wheat noodle. Second, the pork dumpling in chili oil, kind of sweet and spicy. For the main course, I love the Spicy Cumin Lamb. I have the Lamb every single time. The service is very quick reaction than surprised me. They gave me the new chopsticks immediately when I drop it.
5 Walking into Cafe China you think that you're in another era. The bar is right when you walk in and the tables go all on one side and then a back dining area.   We walked in and were seated immediately. Within seconds we had ice cold water and our menu.   I ordered pan fried pork dumplings and the crystal shrimp dumplings. He ordered clear soup with meatballs and sautéed bok choy.   Everything was delicious. I also ordered a Vietnamese coffee. A little to strong but otherwise everything was really nice.   We will definitely be going back!!
1 I had a terrible experience ordering from here. I ordered through Yelp delivery (and to be clear at the end of all this Yelp/GrubHub made it right and helped me get a refund). So I ordered like 3 items and the delivery time was expected to be about an hour (no big deal). After about 20 minutes I get a call and I swore they said they were in the lobby of my hotel. So I go down and no one is there. So I figured they said they were on their way or something so I wait. Now mind you I put on my delivery to ask to ring my room and also get a copy of my receipt. So I wait until the delivery time has past and then I call the number back and he hangs up. I call again and he asks what the address is and hangs up. I finally text and he says my food was left at the front desk. WHAT?! At no point was that said.   So I end up calling Yelp/Grubhub customer experience. At first they are confused and thought I didn't get my food. They put me on hold to call the restaurant... while on hold the restaurant calls me and says exactly what the delivery guy said and says there's nothing they can do for me because they aren't the manager but refuse to let me speak to one and hang up. Yelp called me back very confused why the restaurant called me. Finally they ask me if my food was cold because of this (it had been over an hour so it was). So they give me a refund. I get that wires got crossed but everyone's attitude was "so what, too bad". I spent like $50 on cold food (pre-refund). Not cool.
3 For all of the hype, this place was a major disappointment.  I can cook pretty Sichuan food.  The Mapo Tofu was a major disappointment, we barely touch that dish, it was not even cooked properly.  Every dish we tried was just average for Sichuan, especially for the NYC area.
1 I really wanted to like this place, but everything about it just wasn't good. I read good reviews on yelp and it had a Michelin star so given that I was craving Szechuan food, it thought it would be a great idea.  The moment I walked into the restaurant, my party of 3 was seated at the same table as another party of 3.. even when there were so many tables available. I could understand if they did that if we didn't want to wait, but I think that's not right when there's so much open space and they don't even take reservations for parties less than 10 people.  Nonetheless, we didn't mind. We ordered the cumin lamb, Kung pao chicken, tea smoked duck, and spicy soft shell crab. The server gave our crab to the other party when it came, which we thought was careless because it's an expensive dish and we heard one of them say he was allergic to seafood. It was an awkward dinner after that.   The duck was really bland - couldn't eat it at all. All the other dishes were just okay, nothing that makes them special. The environment, food, and how everything was handled just didn't a good impression.. I wouldn't recommend going there.
1 There is no way this restaurant gets a Michelin Star. I came here with friends with high hopes of a good Sichuan meal but the flavors were lacking. Nothing was spicy, just really salty. I've had better fast food. We ordered the spicy diced chicken, cumin lamb, braised fish in chili oil, and double cooked pork.On top of that, it is 90 degrees outside and the temperature inside the restaurant was 85 degrees. How can diners enjoy a meal in a hot and humid setting. The waiter was very nice and i guess he felt bad that it was so hot, he gave us a complimentary coconut ice cream at the end. After we got our check my friend spotted a roach crawling on the table across from us. If we saw this beforehand,we would've left. Dirty and hot, this is not what we expected from a restaurant in midtown. What a disappointment.
4 Nice environment. Good food. It was no tip required previous but it changed recently and need tip now.
5 So delicious!!! The spicy chicken is so classical! And 豆苗 is really fresh and yummy! Can't help eating all of them with rice. A great place for friends gathering.
5 Went to Cafe China this past weekend while on a city date with my wife. We arrived just after the lunch rush, and were quickly seated. The food was as delicious as it was the first time we had it. Drinks were excellent. Can't wait to visit Cafe China again in the future.
3 This place is OK.   I've had food from here twice for dinner, both times at the recommendation of my colleagues. This place is quite highly rated and even has 1 Michelin star, so I had high expectations.   However, I was disappointed that it did not live up to expectations. The food was average -- we ordered a ton of food, however I just had the vegetable dumplings and the string beans. It wasn't anything mind blowing.  From a service point of view, we asked and noted that there should be extra plates and utensils as there would be quite a few of us dining. They did not provide the extra plates or cutlery, so we settled on using the lids as makeshift plates.   Would not recommend... I'm sure there are better Chinese restaurants around.
3 No surprise no disappointment. The food is alright. Would try for the first time as everything deserves a/first chance. However, if the wait is longer than 30min, go somewhere else. Recommendation for improvement, servers/buspersons chats by their station right by my table (A9?..) The service is nothing to critics. Just a recommendation to improve.
5 My favorite Chinese lunch spot, get lunch items before 3pm, the serving size is small and  so tasty. The wait time is fast and service is fast too.
4 My mom doesn't eat much Chinese food, but I was able to convince her to check out Café China by pointing to its Michelin star. We walked in for an early Sunday lunch a few weeks back, at around 11:15. I guess this place gets crowded, but there was no wait at that hour, at least, and it stayed reasonably calm until we left, at around 12:30. For tourists (we were visiting from L.A.), it seems to make sense to avoid the weekday midtown lunch rush.  The place was clean and attractive, a subtly upscale homey Chinese restaurant, with smart decor and a comfortable, bustling atmosphere. Service was polite and fast, and our server gave us some helpful guidance on the menu. We ended up ordering a minor feast: spicy Chengdu wontons, dan dan noodles, and baby cucumber; Chungking braised fish stew and Chungking spicy chicken.  Spicy wontons and dan dan noodles are really the two things I want at any Szechuan restaurant. Cafe China's wontons hit the spot, thin-skinned and filled with juicy pork, served in a bath of chili oil. The dan dan noodles were a miss, though. The texture was pleasant enough, but the minced pork mixture didn't give the noodles enough flavor. I think these may have been the blandest dan dan noodles I've ever had, if only because the others have been anything but bland.  Our taste buds did get plenty of action from our fiery hot entrees. The fish stew was the cornerstone of our meal, a huge bowl of fish filets (either tilapia or sole, according to the menu, and we didn't ask which) with tofu, bean sprouts, and herbs in a red broth swimming with chili oil and peppercorn. The stew was delicious, peppery and numbing, the fish and tofu both pleasantly textured and flavorful. I also liked the spicy chicken, a plate of diced stir-fried chicken with red chili peppers, each little morsel crispy and burning with dry heat. Both dishes roared with mala spice and required much rice and water. We ended up doubling our order of baby cucumber, the young cucumber fresh and cooling, sweet even in garlic sauce.  I liked Cafe China and would recommend it if you're looking for Szechuan in New York. It wasn't as good, though, as the Szechuan restaurants I go to in L.A. I should've known a midtown Szechuan restaurant couldn't compete with the best of the San Gabriel Valley. This was my first meal out after the death of Jonathan Gold, and it made me miss him, and wonder what he'd have to say about Michelin stars and bland dan dan noodles.
4 We went on a Monday night around 8 pm and were seated within 20-25 minutes of waiting. Service is very prompt. We ordered Pork dumplings in chili oil (amazing!), Dan dan noodles (not bad) and Chungking Spicy Chicken which was the best szechuan chicken dish I have had. This came with a small side dish of rice. Prices are reasonable for a 1 michelin star restaurant. We will definitely come back!
4 Came here Sunday afternoon for lunch and was surprised to find a 30 minute wait. When my friend recommended it, my first thought was, is this going to be another overpriced American style Chinese food? Happy to say, it was not. 30 minute wait was worth it. For the 5 of us, we got a fairly large table. The interior of the cafe was as if you're delivered back in time. Here's what we had:  One of us ordered coffee - it wasn't bold enough in my opinion.  Shredded Beef with Green Chili - this was by far my favorite. Right amount of spice, went well with my rice, and cooked to perfection. Perhaps it was the first thing that came out and I was starving. Mapo Tofu - Great standard! Felt the peppercorn throughout the dish. Rice goes so well with its sauce. Sauteed Chinese Broccoli - definitely necessary to balance your meal! A bit pricey but deliciously sautéed with garlic. Scallion Pancakes - Crunchy and not overly oily with option of dipping into black vinegar sauce. We ordered this to compare with all our other experiences and it held up to our expectations. Five Spice Beef -  standard cold dish appetizer, that was cooked in five spices (you don't say??), with the option of dipping in chilly flake powder. If we didn't order so much food, I may have enjoyed how it was cooked but unfortunately, this came out after 3 main dishes so it tasted bland compared to the rest of the course. Chungking Braised Fish Stew - this was completely new to me. It was sour and savory at the same time. I'd eat this first prior to all the dishes as the sourness might go against the spiciness of the other foods. Tea Smoked Duck - Flavor surely had tea touches. This came out last and I was already full from everything. The description intrigued me and I tasted hints of muddled tea flavor, maybe some star anise? Not particularly my style.   I think the restaurant is very delicious and I would come back. I'd advise bringing out the dishes in a certain manner instead of whatever came out first (like apps before entrees) and make stronger coffee!
4 Came here for lunch on a Saturday since we heard they got a Michelin Star for food. We walked in and the decor really reminded me of the old apartments that my parents grew up in, in China.   We gots bunch of things to share family style, as people should at this kind of place. Cucumbers and husband and wife special to start. Actually what came first was Chungking spicy chicken which I thought was kinda peculiar, but if you insist I eat fried chicken first, I'm not gonna fight you on it.  The chicken wasn't actually that spicy even though but has 4 peppers next to it on the menu which I think is their highest spice rating.   The mapo tofu was a little thicker than normal. I thought it was alright but my parents insisted that they can make better at home.   Green beans and cumin lamb were tasty. It was kinda as expected honestly.   Had rice wine soup for dessert. It was a little bit more yeast/fermenty than most I've had. I liked it, but some people in my party preferred the sweeter version.  The service was better than expected. Quick and polite. The older people in our party appreciated the waiters being able to converse with them in Chinese.   Overall I thought the food here was ok to pretty good. I wasn't particularly impressed with anything. It was a good meal, but I did leave wondering why did it merit a Michelin Star. I've eaten at numerous places that are just as good that don't have stars.
5 Wow. So good. Visiting from DC, I always look forward to good Chinese since we don't have any. This place is legit! I was with picky eaters but they didn't stop us!   Now onto food review. Dan dan noodles were disappointing. 3 pepper chicken - yum! Kung pow - good option. Dumplings were great.    Definitely recommend.
4 A traditional Sichuan restaurant located in midtown, comes with a long wait before being seated (approx. 45-60mins). Inside is filled with Shanghai decor. Coming from a country that thrives on spice, my expectation was high when I was told about the spice level. Unfortunately. I was disappointed since the spice level didn't seem accurate to me. For example, the three pepper chicken had 2 and the whole spicy baked fish had 4   . Strangely, the three pepper chicken was much spicier than the spicy baked fish. However, if you're looking for decent, not too spicy, Sichuan food then this is the place for you!  Service   Ambience  (a bit crowded and noisy but doable) I will definitely return to try the remaining spicy food. Maybe the spice level will be more accurate then :)
4 Not bad Sichuan food in midtown. My friends and I came around 7pm and we were waiting for a table for 4, it was only a 15 minute wait. While a table for 2 was 1hr plus. The atmosphere was cute and a little modern ancient. The food itself was pretty good, the only thing I felt needed improvement was the fish stew. Usually the fish stew at other Sichuan spots have a lot of cabbage inside but this one literally had none and no veggies, the whole pot was just the fish filet. We also got the cumin lamb, it was pretty good prob one of my favorites, dan dan noodles, it was okay. I think they had peanut sauce in this one. The scallion pancake was pretty good though. They messed up one of our orders, and gave us this chicken dish instead, which wasn't bad. but we let them know they messed up our order and they gave us the original order plus the chicken one. We had the pork slices w garlic sauce, so flavorful. It would've tasted so good w the rice if they had given it to us sooner. The servers had a little bit of tude. But that's just the type of vibe you need for an authentic Asian restaurant tbh . I would come back, the food was reasonably priced as well.
5 Hands down my favorite Chinese restaurant in the city!
5 So delicious! Came here because it was close to our hotel and wanted Chinese food that reminded me of Home. This place did not disappoint and exceeded my expectations. I loved everything. We had the following:   - Dan dan noodles - great flavor and not oily at all  - Dumplings in chili oil - chili oil sauce made them so yummy and the filling was delicious - scallion pancakes - so yummy and crunchy! Loved that they were small  - fish fillet with chilies - this was amazing!! My favorite dish. The sauce reminds me of one my grandma used to make me. It has these chilies in it but it was not spicy at all.  - sautéed string beans - very good! Great pairing with the fish.  They also give you a large bowl of rice for each entree that's of no extra charge.   The service was excellent too. Food came out hot and fast. We went around 4:00pm for early dinner and there was no line or wait.   I highly recommend this place. Can't wait to come back and try more!
5 Probably the best meal I have had in New York City.  We walked in on a late Friday afternoon hoping for lunch. We were told to come back in half an hour but were quickly called in again and asked if we didn't mind sharing a table. Nope, we just wanted to eat, so we shared a big table with another couple.  We were hungry but not exactly ravenous so my boyfriend and I decided to have small eats in the form of dan-dan noodles, sweet potato pancakes and chilli wonton soup. They were so delicious. I was rather sceptical at first when I saw the dry and pale dan-dan noodles since I was used to more colourful (read: red) noodles with broth and all, but of course, the waiter had to mix it first (I snapped the picture before the mix) and it tasted so delicious.  It was with regret that we didn't re-visit this place again (so many new places to try in NYC) but if you're around, do drop by at this amazing Chinese place!
5 I eat some type of asian food every day. I live for asian food. This is the best Chinese food I've ever had. In my life.  What we had: Shrimp dumplings Sichuan eggplant Bok choy Fried rice with mustard greens  Pork dumplings  Sweet and sour short ribs  Cold cucumbers   I ate so much I had to walk a mile home so I could Digest.  Best food. Quick service. Reasonably priced.  I can't wait to come back a million times.
2 Such a disappointment. Was looking for a Chinese restaurant with better than average ambiance, and followed yelp reviews here. On a Sunday afternoon this place was hoping, and we felt lucky to score a table without a wait. The place did have some style but.most notably it was quite dark inside. Onto the food...the best dish was a $10 appetizer of cold shredded chicken in a peanut sauce. Tasty, but reminded me of eating leftovers from the fridge. The cold schezuan noodles were disappointing, and one of the chicken dishes we ordered could only be characterized as salty. Like, so salty that we left behind half the plate without getting it packed up (& if you knew me, you'd know that's saying something).  An eggplant dish we got was super greasy but alright...but not so good that it was worth paying for it twice (they attempted to double charge this on the bill). Really not sure what prompts all the great reviews. Unimpressed.

5 One of the best Sichuan restaurants I've been to. Often times Chinese restaurants offer phenomenal food but struggle with providing attentive service, but Cafe China manages to hit both out of the park every single time I visit.  Food: Beef with Spicy Green Peppers - Lunchtime staple. The flavors appeal to almost all palettes, if you can handle some heat. Perfect combination with Rice  Chongqing Steamed Fish - Enough food to feed two to be honest. Incorporates the more traditional numbing Sichuan peppercorn, which can be polarizing, but it's balanced extremely well with the other flavors and handled with care.  Service: One underrated aspect of the service is the bilingual capabilities of all the servers. From my visits with family that only speak Chinese, as well as English-speaking coworkers, the servers have always been incredibly attentive, as well as friendly and warm.  There's a reason for the star. Not only does Cafe China provide a great dining experience, it does so consistently across the half-dozen times I've visited.
5 The mouthwatering chicken cold dish is so delicious and one of my favorites.  The poached chicken is incredibly soft and surprisingly not too spicy even though its bright red hue indicates otherwise.  The fried rice with tea smoked duck is very fragrant and flavorful.  Be prepared for some exceptionally spicy (and oily) food.  The Sichuan cuisine is typically tongue numbing with staple peppercorn recipes.    Other favorites include the following:   Mung bean Jelly - wonderfully squishy   Snow pea shoots with garlic  and sautéed string beans - so flavorful and makes healthy greens taste yummy.  Lunch specials are super affordable during 11am - 3pm on weekdays.  I recommend eggplant in garlic sauce as a veggie option and  braised fish filet with tofu.  The texture was very soft.
5 Café China is a trendy, medium-sized Michelin-starred brasserie serving traditional Sichuanese food in a space furnished with vintage 30s golden-age-of-Chinese-cinema decor and objets d'art. While the waiters do run around rather quickly, they only mean to get your food to you in a timely manner and are not curt. Since the sister restaurant of China Blue in TriBeCa doesn't take reservations for under a considerable number of people, we arrived at 7:30 PM and were out on the waitlist. In the meantime, we walked to the Morgan Library and toured their library, study, and the Wayne Thiebaud exhibition. After an hour, at 8:30 PM, we got the text message from their system and headed over. The host(ess) recognized us immediately from the crowd of people hanging out of the door waiting and flew us to our table. We started off with the pork potstickers - they were out of pork soup dumplings (xiaolongbao) - and the crystal shrimp dumplings. The potstickers came first and, while the filling was perfect, the wrapper was way too thick, so when fried, it was difficult to eat. The shrimp dumplings were just okay. The filling didn't have much flavor and the wrapper was way too thick and gelatinous (more so than they are supposed to be). Both orders of dumplings came with Chinese black vinegar-soy dipping sauces. We then shared the tea smoked duck, shredded beef with green chili, eggplant in garlic sauce, and sautéed Chinese broccoli. The tea-smoked duck was magnificent. While you had to work for it (there was a considerable amount of fat to remove if you don't eat it), the meat was incredibly tender and moist and had a delicious smoked flavor with a hint of jasmine tea. The duck was served broken up, bone-in with a fermented black bean and soy plum sauce - it wouldn't be duck without it! The crispy shredded beef was the epitome of Sichuanese cuisine: loaded with Sichuan peppers and garlic. It's sauce was great, although it was a bit oily (to be expected). The eggplant was okay, but wasn't that memorable. It was doused in a good sauce, but the sauce had far too much oil and the eggplant was so hot for the entire meal that we could barely eat it. The sautéed Chinese broccoli was great. The greens and stalks were perfectly blanched and stir fried for a minute or so, so they retained their structure while still being tender enough to eat. Mixed with brown or white rice and some of the soy black vinegar sauce, the broccoli was great. Our meal ended there, but the theatric surely didn't. The waiter then brought gum and towels with like that tripled in size when poured on with hot water. In terms of food, my only complaints were the thickness of the dumpling wrappers and the oiliness of the beef and eggplant sauce. However, in terms of ambience, the place was perfect except for the fact that it was so loud we could not hear each other. All in all, though, Café China provided a great experience and, in my opinion, and was completely deserving of the Michelin Guide's one star (a great honor!) and my five.
5 Provides great food for lunch, price is affordable. Kung Lao chicken is my favorite, it also comes with a side and a rice. Service is fast, staff is attentive. I dropped a chopstick they gives a new one within 30 second.
5 The best Szechuan food I have ever had in NYC. Not one single bit of disappointment on either taste or service. Personally, the food are exactly as authentic as what I had in Chengdu (spicy but so delicious and irresistible). I recommend the chunking spicy chicken and chunking red fish (so spicy and numbing but honestly i have to say they were amazing). This place gets packed really fast, avoid the rush hours. Can't emphasize this enough, service are great and staffs are very friendly. They were very attentive and constantly checking on us. Definitely come back . Must try!!!
5 Delicious place for lunch. The pepper chicken had my mouth on fire. Other items are mildly spicy but I would say pepper chicken is the hottest one. I give this place 5 peppers
1 The ONLY reason I chose this restaurant is for the fact that I wanted to take my girlfriend out to an affordable 1 Michelin Star-rated restaurant. Michelin rates the food only, and to obtain a single Michelin Star in 2013, and maintain it every year thereafter is no easy task. So, because Michelin rates only the food at a restaurant, I will only speak of the food too.  We started with Dim Sum to share. We wanted Steamed Pork Soup Buns (or soup dumplings, as it's called in many Shanghainese restaurants). This was the one thing I was very much looking forward to, but the server said they were out. Again, this is a 1 Michelin Star restaurant, so to run out of an item that is always on the menu is kind of sad. But we also wanted baby ribs in bamboo leaves, pork sandwiches (also known as pork buns in many other Asian restaurants), and pork pot stickers. The baby ribs and pork sandwiches came out first. The baby ribs were small (like about 2 inches-long). These are $4 per rib, so that was disappointing. Also, the menu describes the dish says as coming with sweet rice, but the rice was as bland as white rice could be. Bland food in any sort at a 1 Michelin Star restaurant is unforgivable. Thankfully the pork sandwiches were very tasty, although I've had just as good, or even better at a few Shanghainese and ramen noodle restaurants. I asked the server when the pot stickers were coming out, and he said he would check on it.   We then received our entrees, but the pot stickers were still MIA. I asked the server where they were and he responded that he forgot to send the order in to the kitchen, so it would be a little while longer. My girlfriend ordered the $14 fried rice with shredded duck, and I got the $16 shredded pork in garlic sauce. The pot stickers came out about 5 minutes into us eating the entrees. They were cooked perfectly, but nothing to write home about either, as the dipping sauce was bland and no different than what one would receive from a generic takeout Chinese American restaurant.  My girlfriend's fried rice didn't look fried at all. It was so void of color, it basically looked like white rice. Also, there were very sparse additions to it. Just an unfairly-small amount of shredded duck, and a larger amount of scrambled egg. And the taste of the dish was as bland as bland could be; again, this is a 1 Michelin Star restaurant. The pork in my shredded pork dish was rubbery and tasted no better than a cheap Chinese American takeout joint. Additionally, one would expect a touch of sweetness in garlic sauce, but here there was none. To be sure, the spicy game was on point as one would expect from a Sichuan restaurant, but the sauce tasted more sour than sweet.   In the end, for a more-expensive-than-Chinese-American-takeout restaurant, and being a 1 Michelin Star-rated restaurant, I had really high hopes. But for two dishes being bland, that's just unimaginable. I really don't understand it all because the ratings on Yelp are overwhelming in the praise of their food, yet I had possibly the most underwhelming experience I ever would've expected.
1 We got stopped because we didn't tip enough. Nasty waiter is greedy and asked us to tip more or we can't get out of the place. I'm always a good tipper and tipped him$10 out of a $100 meal.  But he insisted and forced me to pay $5 more. I will not be returning back regardless how well they cook. There is no law requiring customers to tip at all, you cannot force people to tip, this is very rude and seems like happening around Chinese owned restaurants.
4 We made a reservation about two weeks ago. Food is like home style Szechuanese food. Everything is a little bit too greasy for me, but other than that they tasted pretty good. This is very similar to every other Szechuanese food. We left pretty satisfied but I don't really see why it is worth one Michelin star.
1 Food is ok，but worst service ever. The young waitress who decides customers to sit was so rude and impolite. The extremely hostile sevice made me never want come back again. This lady made this restaurant does not deserve for a michelin star. After the manager replied me, I have to say ,first, I was not late more than 15 minuets. Second, I am ok about the policy, but the point is the host who was so rude. Very disappointed
5 Third time back and I don't regret it. I will always be back for more authentic Chinese food. The spices mix in so well with the flavor, it's the perfect combination of savory and spicy. The mood is set with perfect lighting and there are so many great dishes to choose from. I highly recommend the ChongQing Steamed Fish and the Husband & Wife thing.   Anyway, I just love this place, except it did in fact get more expensive than two years ago
1 This was some of the WORST Chinese food I've ever had. I have never been this caught off guard from a place with such high reviews and a MICHELIN star.   My girlfriend and I were craving Chinese and were intrigued by the diverse menu. We opted for soup dumplings, scallion pancakes, Dan Dan noodles, and Kung Pao chicken. They told us they didn't do soup dumplings anymore so that was a poor start. We decided on the pork dumplings in chili oil instead.   The first dish to arrive was the dumplings. Absolutely zero taste. The meat had no taste, the dough was thick, and the chili oil sauce just didn't do anything at all to make the dumplings taste better. The Dan Dan noodles came next and it was nothing to write home about. The scallion pancakes were tasty, but I've honestly never had a bad scallion pancake. Then, the worst of them all, the basic kung pao chicken. How HOW do you f**k this up? The chicken tasted like pieces of rubber so automatically I was turned off. My girlfriend and agreed and we just ate brown rice and left super bummed.   Never again.
4 Cozy, great food and service. Get there early for lunch. Szechuan noodles were legit. Broccoli is for more that one.
3 I don't know what Michelin is smoking, but this place does not deserve a star. Maybe if you're white, stuck in Midtown East and are craving spicy Chinese food, this would be satisfactory, but my Chinese immigrant parents were not impressed with the seafood choices.   The lobster in particular was not cooked properly; it was prohibitively difficult to extract the meat. The fish is frozen not fresh. That being said, the vegetables were all cooked and seasoned very well. I recommend the bok choy and eggplant. The scallion pancakes are very oily but totally tasty.   We came here for dinner around 6:30 p.m. on a Sunday and waited about 30 minutes to be seated. I would not come back here. I may order the vegetables for takeout to further my healthy-eating goals, but all-in-all, this restaurant is all hype, no delivery. Just kidding, they do offer delivery. I'm just saying: not worth the wait, doesn't live up to the hype.
1 This is the worst Michelin one star restaurant. The hostess and service were below expectations and the food was exceptionally terrible.  Chefs were smoking in front of the restaurant and piles of garbage were on the side walk.  The flies were circling the dishes on the table. New York restaurant grade was pending.  The whole experience was a disappointment.
2 This review is for take out. The process was smooth and everyone was friendly. The dan dan noodles were so dry and barely had any sauce. The Chungking Chicken is so salty it was nearly inedible.
4 Ordered 6 dishes... All good but apparently this place has a Michelin star since 2014? Ive been to plenty of places that offer similar atmosphere, service, and food. This place is good but don't come in with unrealistically high expectations.
5 Great Chinese food , prime products - amazing flavors !!  Well deserved one Michelin Star
2 Pretty decent Chinese food. It's a nice place to just sit down and chat during lunch break and enjoy some of the lunch specials.   My friend and I had an early lunch break and thankfully made it in before the wait started to roll in. We shared the lightly sauteed fish filet and the double cooked pork. For these type of Chinese cafes, I always order the double/twice cooked pork. The pork was pretty sliced thinly on this one. It was also super salty. To the point where we ran out of rice and had to keep getting refills on water. The fish on the other hand, far exceeded the definitely of "lightly" more like sauteed in water. It was tasteless. We had to throw the fish into the pork sauce in order to get some flavor, but then encountered the salty problem.   The other dishes might be better, but I won't be back for another try.
3 Cute Chinese gem in Midtown East. If you want slightly more upscale Chinese food compared to the restaurants in Chinatown or Flushing, check this spot out. Heard this place had a Michelin star so I had to check this spot out.   For a start the ambience: our party enjoyed it a lot! We could tell the owner wanted to go with a retro Chinese theme here so went with a very distinctly 1920s-1930s Republican China vibe. Decor instantly reminded me of those old Chinese and Cantonese jazz lounges and restaurants back in China.   Food wise wasn't as mind blowing, but still decent in taste and quality. We ordered (sorry don't know their English names) 夫妻肺片，麻辣抄手，蒜炒通菜，松鼠魚，醬爆鴉絲，and a duck soup for four people. In terms of price this is definitely not the most budget friendly chinese restaurant in NYC. Total bill was 120 incl. Tax and tip, and I feel you could easily get less than 100 if you ordered the same things in other Szechuan restaurants such as Han dynasty in the east village. Portion wise was small, so be prepared for that. Overall definitely not a good place if you're looking for a restaurant with good price to portion ratios.  As for the food itself. 夫妻肺片 Was delicious, the beef and tripe was aromatic and spicy. 麻辣抄手 I don't recommend because you get only six wontons, and it wasn't spicy at all (even though the dish is supposed to be). It also had a weird sweet taste to it which I don't think is very authentic. 松鼠魚 Was probably the star of the meal, and didn't fail to impress. It was fried to a perfect crisp and the sweet and sour sauce that it was smothered in made it a good balance between sweet and savory. 醬爆鴉絲 Was rather forgettable IMO, because it came with wayyy too many peppers compared to your actual duck strips.   If you want good ambience then Cafe China is not a bad spot. But in terms of food taste, quality, and price, there are better options out there in NYC.
4 Heard a talk given by the owners of the restaurant, and it is interesting to see their journey from financing to the owner of a Michelin star restaurant. It is a nice Chinese establishment in Manhattan, interior not so spacious, but nicely decorated with an antique shanghai style. Have been here twice so far, some of the food items are really amazing, especially cold dishes, but the hot dishes could be better. The menu has a nice selection of Chinese dishes though. The problem is that the hot dishes are not consistently good, one time spicy chicken was apparently way too salty while the bok choy missed some salt. The cold dishes, on the other hand, was prepared really well, and you can tell all the nice spices in the chili oil, very satisfying. Hopefully they can have more consistency in their hot dishes showcase the goodness of Chinese food as a starred restaurant.
5 Innovation caribe and very tasty.  Pork with garlic salad superb.  Spicy noodles were perfect.  Service of impeccable. All good
5 Went for my birthday and we had a blast. Every dish we ordered is so good - definitely recommend the duck tongue, the tea smoked duck and the rice wine soup. The service is attentive and friendly. Overall very impressed!
4 I came here with a friend on a Sunday. The ambience is casual and hospitable. we ordered the three spiced chicken, since it was the most recommended, and the shredded duck fried rice. The food took about 10 minutes to arrive. We were worried about the portions since we were sharing however the portion was definitely enough for 2. Also the chicken came with a small bowl of white rice. The shredded duck fried rice was incredible. The flavor stood out from most Chinese fried rice and there were good amounts of chunky shredded duck pieces in the fried rice.  The three piece chicken for me was a little dry. The chicken itself was slightly over cooked, however the flavor was ok. I wouldn't think this would be the best thing on the menu but I'm yet to try others. The peppers in the chicken were a little too much at some point I had to fish around for the chicken.   All in all the food was very good and affordable. And I'll be back to try other items on the menu.
1 1) Why is a restaurant with 1930s Shanghai decor serving Sichuan food 2) Vegetable dish was overcooked and had dirt in it 3) Other dishes were simply mediocre 4) Overpriced and they try to pack way too many seats into their restaurant
4 One star off for their new reservation policies. They no longer accept reservations for groups less than 8 during the hours of "prime dining" (I believe it's 6:45-8:45), so it's pretty much a guaranteed wait on a weekend night. Which is fine (it's NYC so I'm used to it), but PLEASE give real wait times! We were told a wait time of an hour to hour and fifteen minutes, so we put our name down and went to a nearby swanky bar. We were 40 minutes into our wait time and had just ordered our second drink when I get the text from Yelp saying my table is ready. As I am walking out to make a call to the restaurant, I get a call from the hostess (which is great; some restaurants rely solely on the texting). I let her know that we were anticipating a greater wait time so we will be there ASAP but it'll be 10-15 minutes. She tells me she won't hold the table that long and we will be given 5-10 minutes. I asked if we lose the table, how long will be it for another table and then she puts me on hold, starts yelling something, then comes back and says tersely, fine - 10-15 minutes. (-__-)' okay...   We down our $20 cocktails like we're college kids doing shots at a frat party (real classy) and we arrive about 10 minutes later. We were promptly seated and thankfully, the rest of the meal was smooth sailing (and excellent as always). I just think they need to work on giving more accurate wait times as patrons will schedule their time accordingly.   We ordered a new dish on the menu: Spicy Soft Shell Crab. It's loaded with red peppers and scallions and while it's an aesthetic beautiful dish, I think I will skip it next time as the breading and spices overpower the crab and you can't really tell what you're eating other than something crispy and spicy.   The rock star dish for me is, as always, the Three Pepper Chicken. It is hands down the best Szechuan dish ever. A really likes the Baby Ribs, which has not a single peppercorn in sight and too sweet, in my opinion, but if you need a respite from all the numbing peppers, this would be a good dish to try also.
4 I've had this spot on my list of go-to's for over a year! I ordered the Chinese broccoli sautéed with garlic and a side of white rice.  For someone who doesn't eat pork, duck or beef my options were a bit limited. Still looking to going back another time to try other menu items!
5 Get their scallion pancakes! So yummy! Also get any of their food items with their hot chili! The deserts are also great
1 I had a food poisoning from this restaurant food My doctor told me it was food poisoning! Plz avoid Café China soup!
5 Good food, fair price for a Michelin one star, long wait - you should make reservation before you go
4 Came here with a friend after looking up Michelin star restaurants to eat at. We had to wait half an hour to be seated, but it was definitely worth it. The whole restaurant had a chill, early 20th-century vibe. Service was fast and professional, no complaints there. As for food, we ended up splitting 5 dishes. The husband and wife special(beef tripe) was tasty, but a bit lacking in spiciness. Our other appetizer was the pork dumplings in chili oil. This is a must try for whoever goes here. The dumplings were perfectly wrapped and had great flavor, but what really made the dish was the delicious chili oil. I poured the remaining sauce on my rice later. For main courses, we ordered the twice cooked pork and tea smoked duck. The duck was solid and had that rich smoky flavor. The twice cooked pork was delicious but could have been made better by serving it in cubes or chunks instead of thin strips. Some of the strips lacked the balance between fat and meat that could have been better defined in larger chunks. On the side we ordered green beans, these were tasty, but not the best I've had. Overall, the food was great and not at a bad price.   Also, an underrated service they provide: providing gum at the end of the meal. Lowkey, every restaurant should do this, it helps so much in clearing the palate after a heavy meal.
3 I had high expectations for this restaurant. There were tons of great reviews and being Michelin starred however it was just not up to par for me. It was decent, but not up to standards. I mean, I could have gone anywhere for some quick Szechuan food over loaded with numbing spice.   My boyfriend and I ordered the pancake, steamed crystal dumplings, the mapotofu and the shrimp dish. Of all the dishes the scallion pancake was the best. The dumpling skin was soggy with poor quality stuffing. The mapotofu and shrimp was loaded with numbing spice; despite the mapotofu being level 3 spice, the shrimp dish was actually the most numbing with only given a level 1 spice.   I would have given fewer stars, but perhaps I ordered a bunch of things I did not like. If you are not a big fan of numbing spice I would stay away from all the 'spicy' dishes. I have eaten at numerous Chinese restaurants and I've been more satisfied at lesser known spots. Nonetheless, I think you should give this place a try if you are a fan of the peppercorn-tastebud-numbing-sauce.
5 First time I've had "non-panda express" Szechuan food.  For a table of four, we ordered MaPo Tofu, Chungking Chicken, Wanton soup, sauteed beans. For dessert we had the rice wine soup. All of this honestly was plenty of food - we were crawling to the finish line.  What we ordered wasn't super spicy; it was manageable but the numbness definitely builds up.  I'd say the hour we waited was definitely worth it and would not hesitate to go back again even with a wait. There are so many more dishes on the menu that I would love to try out.
4 It's a bit of a hole-in-the-wall place but great if you want a relatively fast, cheap and delicious Chinese meal. The place doesn't have a lot of seating, so be prepared to share elbow space. Most of their noodle dishes come with a variety of noodle choices, like knife peeled, wide hand-pulled or rice noodles. I had the pan fried beef sticky rice noodles, and my friend had the roast duck noodle soup with hand pulled noodles. For those not used to it, pan-fried may be a little oily - though that's part of the appeal. Portions are generous. Overall good place for a quick bite and a filling meal.
2 Stopped here for a late dinner on a Thursday night, since I've heard lots of good things about the place. The menu isn't that extensive; the biggest choice is probably between getting soup or pan-fried noodles. In the end, I decided on the duck pan fried knife-peeled noodles to go.  The dish was honestly disappointing. The noodles were very greasy, the duck wasn't great (very boney and gamey), and the advertised veggies were lacking. The pluses for me come in the form of costs, wait time, and chili oil. However, there are a lot of other places nearby I would rather try - I definitely prefer the noodles from Xi'an Famous Foods and will probably not be back!
5 Please stop by here I had the dumpling soup and couldn't even finish the deliciousness even though I tried so hard! AMAZING value and flavor I need to go again!
3 not bad. ordered beef noodle soup. knife cut noodles are really good, soup was a bit bland, chewed something sandy a few times (guessing it was the bokchoy not washed super well)
5 I had the hand pulled noodle with duck. This was the best experience I had in China town. I will fly to New York again just to have this. They also had cucumber water instead of regular water which I thought was an added touch. Super casual place and very good food for the buck.
5 I've been here several times during my college days. Why haven't I written a review on them?? Well, now I am! This is one of my favorite hand pulled noodle spots. They have different types of handpulled noodles that you can choose from. Their soup is delicious and I always get their fried pork dumplings! Their soup bowl is huge so it fills you up!  It gets pack in their restaurant, but have no fear they have extra seating downstairs!
4 Very very limited seating and extremely small area inside but food is delicious!  Try the house special soup base or beef soup base with knife peeled noodles.  Soup is extremely refreshing and noodles are not too thick or thin. A perfect al dente that melts after you chew.
3 This is where tourists get their Chinese food. There are so many better authentic Chinese restaurants in the area. I don't understand how this place is so visited and reviewed. If anyone you know is hyping this place up, never trust them again and revaluate your relationship. The dumplings were decent dumplings. Not the best, not the worst. The beef noddle soup had no taste. The broth tasted just like water. I added a lot of sriracha sauce to give it flavor. I also ordered the duck roasted pan fried noodle. I expected actual fried pan crispy noodles, IT WAS LO MEIN... the place is super tiny and cramped. Prices are relatively cheap.
4 We ended up here on a rainy summer Saturday (early evening), and I was thrilled at the lack of a line. We were seated immediately in the small, no-frills dining room. There were several other groups there and as time went on, the place filled up, and new customers were sent down to the basement. The staff was friendly, and no one seemed to care that I had brought in a bubble tea. The bathroom was clean. Somebody had sprawled "resist Trump" on the trashcan lid.   I had the roast duck soup with the fat noodles (basically like the regular, but slightly larger). Each of the respective ingredients was excellent. The noodles had a perfect chewy consistency, the duck - especially the skin - was so succulent, and the broth, while a little bland, was appropriately rich from the duck fat. Still, I thought that the dish was missing a certain je ne sais quoi. There was also a bit of a pungency to the broth that I found a bit unappealing. Sometimes I feel this way about ramen, too. I always crave it, but on occasion I'll walk away not feeling entirely satisfied. Still, I think that this is more of an issue of personal preference; obviously, the soups here are expertly prepared in every way, especially the noodles. I'd split the difference between 3 and 4 and give it a 3.5 if I could.  My boyfriend had the #1 House Special soup (oxtail, beef tendon, tripe, fried egg). I had a few spoonfuls of the broth, which was more flavorful than mine, I think. He was very satisfied with his dish.   We also enjoyed Tsingtaos with our meals, and the total was still only $30. Hand-pulled noodle soup and beer makes for a massive food baby, btw.  I don't know that I would rush back, but I'm glad that I tried it. If I return visited, I would make it a point to try the knife-cut variety.
4 Highly recommend!  Ate here with my husband and his family a few days ago and we all really enjoyed ourselves! We were a group of 8 so we checked in with them about an hour before we wanted to eat and when we were ready they accommodated us right away. It's a small place so I recommend doing this if you're going to have a large group.  We got a couple orders of the chicken dumplings and an order of the pork dumplings. I could have eaten my weight in the chicken dumplings!! I wasn't as much a fan of the pork dumplings but everyone else seemed to really enjoy them.  I got the fried hand pulled noodles with veggies. Very good! Other orders in our group were: fried wide hand pulled noodles with duck, hand pulled noodle soup, and dumpling soup. Reviews were mixed on the duck (flavorful but came bone in). Everyone loved the noodles (mine were the regular ones but those wide ones looked so good too).  I wish I lived in New York just so I could eat here more...I wonder if they ship the dumplings.
4 This place was recommended by a friend and it did not disappoint.  We had a quick trip to NYC and planned out most of our meals.  Glad that we came here.  The place is off the main street and very small.  You are likely going to share a table with a stranger - rubbing elbows and knees.  They have seating in the basement as well.  We both ordered #44 the roasted duck with hand pulled noodles.  We got the regular noodles and the thick noodles.  You can see and hear the chef pulling and swinging the dough around in their little kitchen.  There was a constant line up.  I would definitely return!
4 This small and not-so-fancy restaurant has some great noodles. I tried their noodle soup and also the pan fried noodle. Because the noodles are hand-pulled by the chef, they are amazingly chewy and tasty. I personally would recommend trying the pan fried noodles if you are not so familiar with distinct Chinese broth taste. If you are trying the noodle soup, then I recommend adding cilantro and sriracha sauce to it. Great food for great value. Also, they only accept cash.
4 Solid!  Who could ask for more than a hand-pulled bowl of noodles that tastes like your mom made it?  I got the roasted duck noodle soup, there was a good amount of duck and the broth was clean and light.  Noodles were on point!  The right amount of chewiness that told me they weren't just squeezed out of a machine.  I could tell that I enjoyed it because I completely ruined the chiffon dress I was wearing that day with all the slurping and splashing I did while eating :/  Tips and Tricks -Order a side of scallion tofu and dip your noodles and fixings into that sauce, so good! -Wide variety of types of noodles to choose from -Coconut milk drink is sweet and refreshing after a bowl of noodles!
4 Good food and quick friendly service! The noodle soup was good and the fried dumplings were AMAZING!!!
3 Got the pan fried roasted duck noodle with small wide noodles. It was your average Chinese noodles with extra oiliness since duck is fatty. Nothing special!   Very small inside... can seat about 15 ish people max  Quick service!
4 A friend of my dragged me here to try their renowned hand-pulled noodles. While the noodles were great, the portion was perfect, it didn't wow me. Don't let this deter you-- my taste buds veer away from oily tasting soups this day but on another I might enjoy it a lot! Price wise definitely worth it and a great stop in Chinatown; felt very mom and pops from China and I felt quite comfortable in the authentic-feeling environment
4 Tasty Hand-Pulled Noodles operated in this unassuming spot on Doyers St before Doyers St became cool. Like many other Fujianese-owned hand pulled noodles shop in Chinatown, the restaurant served as a cheap, no-frills spot catering to locals. Now with the booming exotification and popularity of "Chinatown cheap eats," non-Asians also frequent.   The owners are still super nice, and most dishes are still dirt cheap. I would say that this place feels a tad more commercialized compared to other hand pulled noodles shops in Chinatown, but the restaurant is still good.  Enjoy a meal for less than $10 and walk off your food baby in Chinatown.
4 The quintessential mark of a first-rate Chinese hand-pulled noodle joint is if when you walk in and can't immediately tell whether the kitchen staff are slapping each other around in the back or hand pulling the noodles.  A qualification which this joint surely fills.  Great noodle soups, no-nonsense spot, and low prices. It's a keeper.
5 Don't expect the best service (it is in no means bad service) or the most comfortable seating arrangement. Expect what you would expect from a hole in the wall joint. Shared seating and delicious wholesome comfort food.  Like I mentioned, shared seating is pretty much required unless you have a large-ish party. This place is always busy. Utensils are set in a center piece on the table and they have dipping sauces in bottles already there (super convenient and sanitary). They bring out cilantro in quart containers! Which for us was a huge plus because we love cilantro! You pick your soup and noodles. The noodles are what make it! It makes me wonder why all noodles aren't made this way!   Tips: Hand cut/carved noodles. It's more rustic and less uniformed. They take a slab of dough and use a knife to carve out the noodles.  Dumplings here are so delicious and insanely underrated! It's down the block/corner from Joe's so you know... two birds one stone kind of deal.
5 Hole in the wall, diamond in the rubble type of place. The food is amazing. Venue isn't all that but food makes up for it!  They don't usually ID for beer. Haha
5 Cucumbers are out of this world. I can't believe I'm writing about cucumbers and that's it. But, best cucumbers ever! I've tried to recreate this at home but I just can't. Seems so simple but so delicious.
4 I was actually brought here by my Boston sorority sisters who wanted some handpulled noodles and I'm so glad. I've been craving a bowl of soup from here since I came here last week.  I came with four other people on a rainy Sunday, so it was pretty empty. While we were waiting for one of our friends to arrive, they let us sit inside for about 30 minutes just drinking water and chilling. Pretty rare for a Chinatown spot, but it's probably since it was so dead. They did come by and ask us if we were ready to order a few times, but that's understandable since we were sitting there for so long.  I ordered roast duck and roast pork with big wide noodles and they only put roast pork in it, so I was really disappointed, because out of the two I wanted roast duck more. But you know how it is telling people in Chinatown they made a mistake.... so I sucked it up and ate it and one of my friends gave me a drumstick since they got duck. It wasn't that juicy (like you would get at Big Wong) but it was good and I was happy. The bowl is huge, a lot of soup, and they don't exactly skimp out on the meat, but I did order two types of meat hoping for more.  We also shared steamed pork dumplings that were good and I would also recommend. Nothing special or groundbreaking, but still good.  Otherwise, I was happy and would come back or at least try more restaurants like this instead of going to the same spots all the time!
1 I was extremely disappointed with this place.  Every time I create a search online for the best Chinese noodle shops in Manhattan, this place is usually at the top of the list...Sorry, but I don't think so...I have tried many noodle shops in Chinatown and elsewhere and my favorite choice is Super Taste...HANDS DOWN!....The dumplings at Tasty were the blandest dumplings I have ever experienced...not too mention the soup broth was boring as well....The best thing I had here were the pork wontons that were in my soup...After they were gone...So was I.
2 I came here for a quick pickup during lunch break. I had never been here before but I decided to try it out via Yelp reviews. Unfortunately I was incredibly disappointed in the quality of the food. I ordered a simple Broccoli and Garlic Sauce with White Rice and asked for some chili sauce on the side. It tasted incredibly bland; the chili sauce tasted like rotten garbage. I had the runs for a few days afterwards. Nice staff (rarity in Chinatown) but never again.
4 Loved everything. The noodles were amazing but were heavy in veggies so it was hard to appreciate the noodles. We got the duck hand pulled noodles. The noodles were thinner than they looked in a lot of the photos but were still amazing. The dumplings were incredible and the special sauce on the table was unreal. Highly recommend.
4 4.5 stars  Definitely a hole in the wall place. I loved it here because it fulfilled my soup noodle and dumpling cravings.   I ordered the #1 special, and it was delicious. The noodles were one of the best I've ever tried. Amazing since it's hand pulled, made right there. And the steamed dumplings were perfection. I might've liked the dumplings more actually...  Overall, a delicious and cheap eat.   FYI: expect to eat with paper plates and plastic utensils
5 Really good, not greasy Chinese. The pan-dried vegetable noodles had a great texture to them and lots of veggies.
4 The name sounds a little generic, but there are some solid items here. I'd recommend the soups over the stir fried noodle dishes, but both are a solid choice either way.   The Knife cut noodles are really quite good, and the serving sizes are very reasonable, especially in comparison to the price.   The duck is good, but I would recommend having either beef or lamb here.
5 The perfect noodle place. Bar none. You can choose the style for your noodle, also whether with soup or fried, and the ingredients that come with it. It is so tasty and feels like home.
2 Decent experience. Not sure if it was just me but it was a little difficult to find this place too. First impression was that it was cramped and small. They don't take card but luckily there was a Chase literally across the street.  I ordered the knife cut beef stew noodles. It was okay and definitely had better. Although it was pretty fresh and made pretty quickly. I think I had higher expectations just cause usually you expect a lot more out of authentic hole in the wall places. The prices were really good. Most noodles on their menu were priced around $8 which is pretty good if you're on a budget.  Overall, its a low maintenance place and budget friendly spot but don't expect amazing food.
4 This is definitely what I would call a hole in the wall, although probably a step up from Nan Zhou Hand Drawn Noodle House, which is a little less hygienic appearing.   My friend and I stopped by on our tour of Chinatown and were surprised to find all of the tables occupied before 11 AM (they open at 10:30 AM). However, they were nice enough to accommodate us at the table they used for prepping. I couldn't tell if they had additional basement seating, because someone requesting a two person table definitely followed the waitress down the back stairs and never surfaced again (dun dun dun), but from what I can tell, they are a tiny shop regardless.  I went with the knife shaven beef noodle soup and my friend chose a hand pulled stir fried noodle. Both were great options, depending on whether you are in the mood for more soupy or dry noodles. I appreciated that the stir fried noodles were not as greasy or salty as I've had it before, but still super tasty! The beef noodle soup was also great - perfectly seasoned (ie. not too salty), and the beef was nice and tender! They don't leave suan cai out on the table for you, but if you ask for it, they will bring you a little plate of it.   Portions are generous. I believe my friend and I both took at least half of our orders home for dinner!
3 Mediocre. I checked this place out in the middle of the afternoon after completing some court business. I was inclined to go to Xian, but I always go there so I decided I should branch out. What a disappointment. The food wasn't bad, but it was bland and undistinguished. Service was friendly, but the food took way too long to come out for a restaurant of this sort. Definitely not worthy of the top rating on Yelp - save yourself the trouble and go to Xian.
4 Pan-fried noodles with vegetables was delicious.   Will definitely order again.  I ordered on line, and it was ready when I arrived.
5 This was one of my favorite New York experiences on my past trip. While many people might question sitting down at a seemingly "lack-luckster" restaurant, this place proves not to judge a book by its cover. I ordered the pork dumpling hand-pulled noodle soup and my boyfriend ordered the pan fried noodles with chicken.  First of all, so much food!! We both paid less than $8 per dish and had way more than enough food for one meal, you really get the bang for your buck. Most importantly, it was delicious. My dumplings and noodles were very fresh and the broth was seasoned perfectly. The staff was friendly, not at all pushy, and very relaxed. I give this entire experience a 5/5 for authenticity, flavor, and pleasant employees.
5 One of my favorite hole-in-the-wall restaurants to visit in Chinatown for the experience (it has two levels, both of which are very cramped, and is located on an irregular L shaped street that feels like its the site of a Triad den in an old school HK crime drama), for the tasty, chewy, gummy handmade noodles, and for the fact that there is a BYOB option here.  My favorite thing to start with, especially in the hot summer months, is the spicy cucumber salad, which involves smashed cucumber (like you'd find in some sort of artisinal mixologist's cocktail) in a bed of spicy oil and sesame oil, so that it absorbs the flavors. The steamed dumplings are good but nothing noteworthy.   The main event are the noodles. I like the thick, knife cut noodles, dry sauteed with chicken and shrimp. The noodles are perfectly cooked, a fine balance of the soft exterior and slightly chewy interior. The flavors are simple and fresh and delicious.   As mentioned, there is the option for BYOB, although figuring out what wine to pair with Chinese food can be pretty challenging.   I recommend to any friends looking for noodles in Chinatown. Service is generally competent and speaks English well enough.
5 No ambience but who needs that when the noodles are  so damn good. We got the fried noodles with chicken. The chicken was moist and tasty and the noodles were tender and well flavored. The pork dumplings were your standard dumpling fare. Kimchi was excellent, not too spicy. Worth a visit.
5 The dining room is tiny and they squeeze you in. but they don't disappoint in the food department. We all got the house special #2 and it was delicious. The pork dumplings were delicious.
4 Pan fried noodles are awesome! The roasted duck soup was okay. Good but not as good as the pan fried. My wife got the veggie pan fried and it was the winner. The soup broth was too bland.   We also got the fried chicken dumplings. They were a solid win and the brown sauce was drink it with a straw yummy. Definitely get them.   Overall, would I come back? Absolutely. Would I try a different soup? Yes.   We came at 9:00pm on a Monday and no wait but you still sit close to everyone slurping their soup so be ready for that fun sound.
4 Can't wait to go back. Yes, it's a tiny hole-in-the-wall spot you could easily walk right past. That would be a big mistake. These crazy cheap hand-pulled springy noodles are the real deal. We got one soup and one fried (no sauce) dish, both loaded with crisp veggies. Plus a 10 count of pork dumplings, half of which the 7 year old promptly inhaled. The duck fried noodles took the win by a hair, but the beef soup was a close second. Yep, can't wait to go back!
5 House special panfried handpulled noodles is the best hangover cure in Manhattan, hands down.
5 The best! They even have a bathroom that's pretty clean! Awesome noodle soups - my favorite is the fujanese wonton! My husband loves it since they'll add "$2 of beef tendon" to any soup he orders. What more could you ask for?
5 This is now my favourite noodle shop in Chinatown, and here's why:  1) Their strings of doughy goodness is incredibly fresh, and served with the perfect touch of chewiness beyond al dente. They're akin to the neutral, subtly aromatic taste I'm used to growing up in China.   2) The abundance of veggies in every bowl: the generous amount of bok choy is just how I like it - to balance out the meat.  3) The service. One shouldn't expect much in Chinatown, where every restaurant space is old, tight, and run by (likely) underpaid staff. But this spot somehow managed to exude organization & friendliness amidst the chaos. We ate at 3pm on a Saturday, and there was still a constant stream of customers.  I'm definitely going back soon!
4 GREAT place to eat!!  One of our best meals in NYC!!  Love the pan fried noodles, pan fried dumplings, and steamed dumplings.  The place is small so it can get pretty crowded.
5 This place rules and is hands down one of the best noodle places in NYC. For about 6-8 bucks you can get a huge and delicious noodle bowl and complimentary hot tea. I recommend the knife-peeled noodles with pork. I try to eat here every time I visit Chinatown.
3 Place is packed! Has upstairs and downstairs with customers constantly filing in. Various take out orders, and lots of people dining in.  Wide variety of options for menu. Nice, cozy feeling to Asian restaurant. Wait time longer than expected. Seems a little tight for a place.  All ages, demographics seen visible here. A good fit for all! Efficient, fast paced ordering, with great staff. On point with orders, menu, etc.  A little unorganized to my liking, not the tidiest place to be at, fine experience overall. Don't let the setting impact you greater than what you came for, the food!  Fresh food, straight out the pan. Hot and delicious. Pan Fried Noodles with chicken and shrimp a great choice. Fresh and hot out the kitchen. Cooked to brilliance.  Friendly staff. Hard working. Never seen a lady in the front work so much. Literally takes care of everything A to Z.  A little bit pricey for my liking. Restaurant in Chinatown that is not the best, yet prices say otherwise.  Pricing is the reason for my 3 star and not 4.
2 I honestly can't understand why this place is so popular. The soup base is not particularly appealing it's just chicken stock with msg for every flavor. No spices. No herbs. The meat was just eh whenever there was any meat as most of it was the bones. The vegetables were undercooked. Maybe the noodles are hand pulled but their flavor and consistency is lacking compared to other noodle shops.
3 Not much to look at from the outside alley.  Street level dining was filled so we ate in the basement.  Zero atmosphere.  Extremely casual.  Quick wait staff.  Lukewarm tea in pot.  Ordered mixed fish all soup w/noodles and seafood noodles.  Food came in 5 min.  Soup could have been more savory.  Fish balls and noodles were fine.  The seafood noodles were oily and lacked flavor.  Seafood was a bit scarce.
2 Just average... The steamed pork and veg. dumplings and the tofu were really good, but the soups had nothing special.  There are other places around better than this one.
3 This place doesn't give you as much meat as the Lam Zhou pulled noodle place also near Broadway. The flavor of the soup was also very average and actually not that flavorful. They do give you a lot of noodles to stuff you up.   The noodle dishes are around $8, and you have the option to get veggies, dumplings, beef, pork, shrimp ...etc I got the beef and beef tendon. The meat slices are a little dry to me, and I prefer soft, chunky type of beef stew.   The noodles are good, I got the regular round kind. Just wish that the soup could be a little bit more flavorful to pair with the noodles.
5 We ordered the #1 and #2 House Special Noddle, chicken and beef dumpling, Roast Duck pan fried noddle. The food was really tasty for a decent price. It's a taste of home far away from home and my family was really happy about that since we were craving Asian food. The hand pull noodles was delicious. The shop is a little hole in the wall but it was packed after we came in.
3 Good food, decent prices, but service was a little rough. Cramped seating and very unorganized. Didn't like the fact that my food came out five minutes before my partner's (I won't eat until everyone at the table I served). It was almost like we were rushed out due to the lack of seating. My partner liked the ramen, but my fried rice wasn't really anything special. Maybe a good place to order takeout, but I can't recommend eating inside. The place really could use a good cleaning and some organization.
4 A small place but there's seating downstairs also. We started out with the steamed pork and vegetable dumplings. Not many places has ponzu sauce available but you must try the dumplings with this sauce! It's so yummy!   I ordered the general tso chicken. I would recommend getting the small. It was a good size portion. The sauce tasted similar to orange chicken but it was still good. My only concern is the sauce was a super thick sauce that kinda resembled putty. I tried to dip the broccoli in the sauce but it wouldnt even stick.   Also, jasmine tea is given with every table and it's very refreshing to drink between bites or after your meal. But overall this place is a cheap but good place to eat!
5 This is one of our favorite places in NYC area. There's nothing like it! I got regular hand pulled vegetable noodles. So darn tasty! The name says it all. It's a very small, authentic place. My dude got the knife cut noodles with duck. He wasn't impressed wth the duck but loved everything else. The noodles are just the best! We made a wrong turn and ended up in Chinatown by accident. We didn't even have to discuss where we'd be eating.
4 Simple, humble, authentic and delicious food. Don't be fooled by the unassuming store front, delightful flavors lie between those walls.  There may be a wait for seating as the dining area is small but it's worth the wait. The food is all made fresh to order.  The noodles are hand pulled and perfect. We tried the stir fry and soup dishes and they  were both excellent. The dumplings were amazing. Had the fried chicken and veg dumplings and they were packed with fresh flavor, pan fried with no greasiness...I would go back there just for these and eat 2 portions!  The staff are friendly and efficient.
5 Small place that offers AMAZING hand spun noodles. Loved the #1 House Special and the fried dumplings were to die for. You have to check this place out next time in NYC, you will not be disappointed.
5 The vegetarian dumplings and the pork dumplings are amazing! Had the pork dumpling noodles soup was the best!
2 I chose the hand pulled noodle soup with chicken dumplings.  It was quite bland, but with the toppings available at the table you can build up the flavor to your liking.  It was still missing something; I've had various noodle soups throughout Chinatown which was more flavorful (meaning not salty).  I also ordered chicken filled fried dumplings.  Also meh.  The service was quick though; and the huge bowl of noodle soup was good for 2 people.  This place is over-rated.  Maybe I had high expectations but the noodles' texture and taste was a star above a store bought one. I'd rather go to any of the noodle house establishments off of Mott st. Still they are a better choice.  I asked 3 times for a pot of tea; each time with a different person. It never came; it was a weekday and the place was full but everyone at their table was served tea. That's the first thing they should bring...very disappointing.
5 Amazing hand-pulled noodle soup and dim sum appetizers! I've been here several times and it's one of my favorites. Everything I've ordered here is delicious and the staff is attentive and friendly. Could not recommend more. *also it's fun to see the noodles made through the window in the back!*
4 They have a bunch of options to choose from, but I went for knife-cut pan fried chicken noodles.  knife-cut looks like what it sounds like: noodles roughly chopped up with a knife. I like how those noodles have a thin side and a chunky middle sometimes. It's ~almost~ the consistency of pad see ew from a Thai restaurant, if you've ever had that. It came with a LOAD of veggies, which I'm not mad at; most of the veggies was bok choy. They chicken tasted like chicken you'd get when you order chicken & broccoli from a ~good~ Chinese food place. And the portion was great: it can feed two people, or one reeeally hungry person.  On the table, they have jasmine green tea free of charge. Drink as much as you want, there's a whole kettle. They also have hot oil, siracha, soy, and vinegar. Oh, and a tub of chopped up cilantro if you wanna sprinkle some on your dish.  I liked this place, I plan on coming back to try other stuff.  ..so, why take off one star? because the bf ordered a soup that didn't have much flavor like he expected. :(   BUT! maybe it was just that one plate...  Their dumplings, however, are pretty bomb. They're tasty and all of it is freshly made just for you. :') When you ask for them fried, they're not completely fried like some places do them. The bottom is fried. That's fine with me, it's not the first place to do that to my dumplings.  To wrap it all up: I'll be back for more noodles and dumplings~  OH, AND THEY'RE CASH ONLY!*
4 This noodle shop has been around for quite some time. In the recent years I've noticed it got cleaner. Perhaps from the pressure of all the new restaurants, bars and coffee shops next to them. Nonetheless, we always welcome clean and nice places!   Service is friendly. Though they don't speak a lot of English, they try to and they make recommendations when you're unsure. A friend wanted the pineapple fried rice and someone said "not recommended. Try noodle."  The noodles are great- you have seven choices to choose from! I chose the small wide hand pulled noodles with the beef stew. It was a fair amount of beef and noodles and the green veggies (bak choy) were very fresh. It's always nice to get veggies without the extra charge like some other places.   Though prices are rising in Chinatown ($7.75 for the beef stew noodles), it's still considered a cheap eat. So come on by and visit this shop on the famous Doyer Street!
4 Tiny little place in Chinatown, this is definitely no fine dining experience, so don't expect appearances to be much. Service is also just minimal, they will bring you water or tea and come take your order but that is about it. But it is understood that it is supposed to be a quick service place. The noodles are amazing, the texture is cooked to perfection, and however I wasn't too impressed with the broth flavor. The soup was relatively bland. The portions are definitely impressive considered the cheap prices. We also ordered some broccoli to share and that was absolutely delicious. It is just some broccoli they tossed with chopped garlic in a light brown sauce and I have no idea what else but it was so good. I was trying to dunk the broccoli soaked with the sauce in my soup in hopes of transferring some of that flavor into the broth.   I will definitely be back to try some of the other noodle dishes, as I really liked the way they make their noodles.
4 There is nothing new in my review that fellow Yelpers previously wrote about.   We ordered Roast pork noodle soup and a panfried noodle (not the Chinese American crispy kind) dish between the two of us. I wasn't too thrilled by the panfried dish, but the soups were pretty on point. Noodle bowls are mainly noodle, broth (seemed a deep flavor to me), some greens, with a tub of cilantro on the table if you'd like a garnish, and if you opt for a protein, you'll find that. This is pretty much what I expect from a fresh hand-pulled noodle joint, not much else. You go for the fresh, on the spot, handpulled noodles.  If you find yourself down in this neck of the woods on a weeknight, prime-o seating and an empty restaurant is to be expected. Other brownie points: the cashier, who also took our order, spoke English: very helpful.   to sum it up: fresh noodles, good soup, not very expensive. Stop on by.
4 My husband and I went in for lunch today. We had kimchi, pork veg. steamed dumplings and #2 House Special Noodle soup. We split it all. The food was really fresh and delicious! When we walked in we were seated right away and the food came very quickly.  The tea served was very good as well.  The only downside is that the place is small so our table was small and could barely fit our food and drinks.   I would definitely recommend this restaurant!
4 When you finally become a regular is when they start giving you better customer service. The hand pulled noodles are good with just the soup. Their pork chops are not the greatest. But I would recommend their knife peeled noodles with shrimp and pork! Super delicious!
4 Good noodles but cramped space. Not the most sanitary either. This is more street stall food as every seat will get filled all times of the day.
5 If you're about authentic food and not aesthetics, this is the place. Crowded, simple, but food is amazing. We got different variations of the hand pulled and knife cut noodles. If this is your first time, I would recommend the beef noodle soup. Good prices and cash only.
5 The food is always so delicious even when we order from seamless.   Today after I got my delivery I want to change the type of noodle, the person was so nice to me and helped me to get the type of noodle I want and gave me a new soup. Love their noodles and dumplings and he service is great!
4 I finally made it here and am glad I did; as with most Asian places, there's always something for a vegan to eat. I got the Knife-Peeled noodles in a tofu noodle soup; the tofu was served on the side. Wonderful, chewy noodles in a vegetable broth, served in a bowl so large I got to take home a pint.  Dumpy and divey? Yes--and we liked it that way! (We loved it!) Jasmine tea served in a styrofoam cup. Really happy I chose to walk down Doyers Street today; I'll definitely go here again--and now I'll be checking out Xi'an, since there's a location a few blocks from where I live.
4 So about it.  Broth is light in body but really flavorful. The place is dingy, but whatever, a bowl of noodles is like $7 and super filling.   The chashu was not good though, really tough and dry. Next time I'll probably just get noodles.
3 If you're craving fresh, handmade noodles in a hole-in-the-wall joint via Chinatown, Tasty Hand-Pulled Noodles is a good bet. Assuming you don't walk right past it at first, inside you'll find a bare-bones operation with only a few seats; leave your party of 10 at home.  More importantly, they offer a full menu of hot dumplings, fried noodles, and noodle soups, the latter two of which involve like 6 (?!) different varieties of hand pulled noodles.  We started with the pan fried dumplings, which were really nice; I much preferred  these over the typical Chinatown dollar dumplings. The skins tasted handmade as well, and had the right ratio of crisp to chew.  The noodles themselves too were quite good. We tried the thin and wide noodles, both in roast duck noodle soup. They were pretty clumped together, which led to a lot of broth splashes on our clothes as we tried to fish them out, but both had a great chew and texture. I personally preferred the thin version better; it held up just a little bit better to the broth.  What I did find disappointing was the rest of the soup itself. It was clearly a good stock, but didn't have any discernible flavor. Of course all the condiments on the table (vinegar, chili, soy sauce, cilantro, etc) helped us to customize our own bowls, but I've never been very good at getting the ratios right with that sort of thing. I'd much rather have a broth that's pretty much ready to eat as-is, rather than spend half my meal trying to improve upon.  But for only ~$8.50 for a giant bowl, I really can't complain. Next time I'll have to try some of the stir fried noodles, or at least another variation of the soup!
5 I was craving authentic Chinese hand-pulled noodles and saw this place got many reviews. They weren't lying! This place is a classic Chinese restaurant: cheap, small, cash only, and delicious! I can be pretty critical when eating authentic Chinese food, so this place passed my test.  Price Under $10  Positives + Authentic + Affordable + A lot of noodles + bok choy + meat + Pretty fast service  Negatives  - Too cramped and slightly dirty (but that's basically expected) - Tea is not strained, which is annoying - Cash only  Also, because it's such a small place, I would come during the off hours so you don't have to wait.
4 Tucked in a small side street in Chinatown, this place delivers the goods.  Rightfully called Tasty Hand Pull Noodles and that's what they serve.  Place is a bit of a Chinatown dive with tight seating, electrical cords everywhere, and shelves to potential bang your head against, but service was good and delivered by friendly women that run the place.  I don't necessarily like the water that just sits at each table and the tea pot was what was left from the previous customer, but the noodle soups and the dumplings deliver.
3 This place was so... grimy. I've forgotten how hole-in-the-walls work, and boy this place nails it! The dining area is for customers but also for them to stock items, which is just classic hole-in-the-wall joint. I'd give this place four stars, but I found a soup spoon with left over noodle on it from previous use and I just can't put up a fourth star for them. The noodles were great! Different types to choose from and a variety of toppings on the menu to pick from. Less than $10 to get full in Manhattan? Sign me up! I'd probably do take out next time or something.
5 This bonafide hole in the wall easily has the ***best*** Chinese noodles in NYC.  Avoid coming here on weekends as lines and wait times get long; my friends and I waited in line for 20-30 minutes, and then almost an hour for our food to arrive.  I highly recommend the knife-peeled noodles. As a vegetarian, I found the most basic vegetable pan-fried noodles incredibly satisfying.   Cash only!
5 Talk about those places that are "blink and you'll miss it", Tasty Hand-Pulled Noodles is absolutely one of those places. Thank God my friend knew about this place because I wouldn't have even walked down the street it was on, let alone recognize it by walking by it. It's one of those places that when you arrive you're like, "is this it?" You're not sure, but you open the door and hope for the best...  The inside is tiny. Probably 7-10 tables. Small tables that fit max of four and thats by putting two tables together.  One girl works the entire floor while the other answers calls and takes your money. They've got a system down and it works.  Oh em freaking gee the food.  First- the fried dumplings were amazing. Probably some of the best dumplings I've ever had. The Soup. I ordered the pork soup bowl. For $7 I got an enormous bowl of soup with what felt like a pound of hand-pulled noodles and a large piece of pork. So filling. So delicious and I pretty much ate every bite.  A $12 meal in New York is extremely rare and especially a good tasting meal for that prize. This place is amazing. Would I go back? You bet. I would recommend it to anyone who lives or visiting the area. If you like authetic Chinese cuisine this hits the spot. Pay no attention to the lack of decor on the inside- you're there to eat and you'll be happy you did eat there once you're in.  Enjoy!
4 I was craving asian food and was recommended this place by a friend who just recently moved to New York. The area was pretty familiar for me as I was in the area the day before eating dim sum at Nom Wah. I came with a group of 8 so seating would be a nightmare if it was on a busier day since there's very limited seating.  I ordered the Roast Duck noodle soup with fried pork dumplings as an appetizer. The food came out and the group dug into their food. My soup was quite delicious, but the dumplings hit me right in the spot I was craving.   I think the pan fried noodles tasted better than the soups if you were undecided on which one to get.
5 I went with a group of 3, it's a small place but it's very cute, the food was so good, and service was great. Prices were extremely reasonable too, all of us loved it
3 Popped in for a quick lunch. It's been 20min and we've sadly only gotten a wrong order. We ordered the gyoza, and got steamed dumplings. Then they took the dumplings back and tried to fry the steamed dumplings... which turned out to be an oily soft mess that doesn't resemble fried dumplings at all. I got the oxtail noodle soup and hubby got beef noodle soup. The flavoring seemed watered down. Even after adding a ton of chili oil, it only slightly resembled the classic noodle soups we love. It's been a long time since we've been back, and it seems a lot has changed for the worse. I hope to find a better beef noodle soup place soon :/
3 3 stars because i felt that Lamzhou was a better deal than this one.   I got a beef stew noodles for $8.40 after tax, while I could have both a noodles bowl and an order of dumplings at the other place for $9.  Their noodles were fresh, handpulled, but they skimped on the meat. I felt like i had too little amount of stewed beef. LOTS of veggies (bok choy) though  Broth was a-ok.
5 I ordered the beef noodle soup and I got the knife shaved noodles. I actually liked the thickness and texture of the noodles. Overall, it was delicious, filling, and a great price.
5 Hands down one of the best places I have at in Ny. Walked about an hour or so in the cold to find this hidden gem  for the best ramen  I have tasted, so damn good   ....
4 Fortunately didn't have to go through much of a wait since my friends were already there when I arrived. Ordered noodle soup with seafood. The waitress nicely asked if I wanted the soup base to be beef soup or just plain soup and I choose beef. The food was very tasty. Be prepared that it would crowd up on holidays - seems like a super touristy destination along with Nom Wah Tea Parlor (which is a few steps away)!
4 Really delicious hand pull noodles!! Great prices too! Would definitely come back again!
4 Great: -Any of the hand pulled noodles! *Slurrrp* -Prices -- Most below $10 #winning -Service (surprise surprise) - this is quite refreshing difference since the waitress is actually quite friendly -- not very typical for a Chinese hole in the wall place (or maybe because it's not a very busy day)  Not so great: -Fried chicken dumplings (has some unwanted chicken smell for some reason) -Space hygiene - place looks like failing health inspection - but hey it's a hole in the wall after all..so I shouldn't expect for it, right?  Anyhow, I will be back for more next time.
3 The service is warm and friendly, such a cozy feeling upon entering. The food is plain, and just ok. Lots of combinations. I ordered the dumpling noodle soup with vegetable broth. The noodles themselves was good, but dumplings were not great. The meat eaters all loved theirs, so maybe it's more of a 4 star for meat eaters. The seaweed and cucumber appetizers were too sweet for my liking, but huge portions - small was plenty for the 4 of us.
2 The service is terrible here. We were also shoved down to the basement. The first floor was super crowded. I am not sure it is up to the fire code to stuff so many people together in such a small place. I could barely moved pass the people that were waiting in line. Their menu was way too big, I wish they could have concentrated on just a few things. The veggie in the soup was overcooked, and the beef slices I had seemed old. The noodle was also a bit uneven, with some overcooked and some undercooked.
4 the food here is very tasty! i believe they are known for their noodle soup, but as i don't enjoy soup with my noodles, i had the special pan fried noodles that came with chicken beef and shrimp it was full of flavor and was a big portion i also ordered the chicken dumplings fried- unfortunately it came out more steamed. while the food is amazing, the wait is insanity the restaurant is tiny, so there really is no space to wait, but considering how popular it is, people cram into the entrance. its a mom and pop shop with very few workers the customers behind us waited 10 minutes for someone to clear the food from previous patrons at their table. they also had to get their own menus ! the tables are tiny and it feels like you're elbow to elbow with random people, but the food is worth it !
3 I had the duck noodle soup, and it was okay. The soup itself was a little oily for my liking. I really enjoyed the stir fried noodles that my friend ordered instead. It was also super oily, but I liked the texture of the noodles much better.
3 3.5 Stars  I don't know what it is about trying restaurants and the if the first time is wonderful, then I'd be sure disappointed the second time. I got the duck noodle soup and it was fantastic the first time, but all the other times I've came it, the food was just okay.
5 hole in a wall place i found thanks to yelp. i had a delicious place of pan fried thick noodles with veggies and roasted duck. cash only like most of these eateries and very limited table seating. would love it if a place this solid would open in miami. i cant wait to go back and get more noodles!!!
4 It is sooooo cheap and tasty. Since the place is so small, you have to wait sometimes. I come here when I am craving for some real chinese food.
5 Went for the first time on Tuesday, had to go back again by Friday. Could not stand the craving for the thin hand pulled noodles any longer. First time I had it with duck, today with the pork dumplings. I prefer the duck.  The hours say 10:30. I showed up at 10:30, the door was open, but I did not get my food until about 11:30. Normally they are super fast, so I think the hours actually begin at 11. But they were super nice and let me come in from the cold anyways. The service is efficient and fast. I just got there too early. Next time (probably Monday) I will show up at 11:15 for my noodle breakfast.
4 Amazing hand pulled noodles for great price. The veggie broth was super tasty, as well as the texture of the noodles and loved the veggie dumplings as well. 4 stars only because it took a very long time for the dishes to come :(
5 Portions are huge! Prices are cheap! The hand pulled noodles are good! Will definitely be back to try other things on the menu!
4 The pulled noodles are decent. It is definitely worth a try. The soup/broth is a bit disappointing, a little too mild without enough flavor and complexity.
3 Very good noodles. The menu offers a variety of noodle types. We ate in the downstairs seating area, where there was a funky smell.
4 In the mood for a delicious bowl of hand pulled noodles? Well you are in luck - here you can customize the size of your noodles and even have your vegetarian noodle selection drenched in beef soup. The service is quick. Everything is reasonably priced. Most entrees/dishes range from $7-9 and it comes with a pot of hot tea made with loose tea leaves. The seating is tight but once you are situated over your yummy meal, nothing else matters. The noodles are smooth and glides down the good o'l esophagus nicely but can be a choking hazard for kids as the noodles come in long continuous loops. Just bite them all down to size and you will be good to go.  Cons: Although the dumplings are delicious, they come in a more sweetened flavor than salty. That was the one complaint the husband had.   Overall: This is a great place to enjoy noodle soup with a handful of friends/family.
5 A hole in the wall noodle spot that's definitely a gem. My friends and I have been tasting various noodle places in Chinatown, and Tasty Hand-Pulled Noodles is absolutely one of the best. During a busy lunch time in the middle of the week, we were seated quickly, and were able to get our food quickly as well. The portions are hearty and the price warms the heart and wallet even more.   We were seated right outside of the kitchen where we were able to watch the chef make the noodles, and customers coming in and out for take out. I got the house special with regular hand-pulled noodles on a cold winter day, and oh boy, did it hit the spot.   Definitely a spot to visit for an authentic noodle experience!
5 This little hole in the wall is a perfect place for a quick bowl of noodles or dumplings.   We sat next to the kitchen, watching gusts of steam rising up while a man hand pulled noodles of all shapes and thickness.  The vegetable dumplings were fantastic. Filled with ginger and garlic as well as veggies.  I had a beef broth with vegetables and pork dumplings all mixed together. Divine. My dining partners had beef soup with beef. Everyone was happy.  A quintessential NYC Chinatown experience.
5 Delicious noodles! When you walk in, it's a really crowded stuffy place, but food is amazing and the noodles come out in this huuuuge bowl, the kind where your soup spoon gets lost and you have to chopstick them out. You can choose a beef or veggie broth and whatever meats you want. Truly filling and delicious with a big bang for your buck. If you want hot noodles to warm up your soul, this is just the place to go.
5 We are here the day after Christmas. We had been walking all day, so we were looking for a place that could seat us quickly and we're incredibly needy. The waitstaff delivered big time! All the food was incredible and we really got a kick out of being able to see the noodles pulled in the back.
4 delicious and cheap hand pulled noodles. I usually just get their beef hand pulled noodle with soup, and add a bunch of their chopped cilantro. Fast and good service. Place is small and a bit fun down but consistent and good food.
2 Tiny little restaurant with very limited space and not the cleanest either! Most ordinary noodles I've ever had in my life. It's definitely over hyped. I'm still not very sure where all the positive stars came from! Not worth the try, especially you are just touring the city. Save a meal and go somewhere else for something better.
5 As some of the other reviews state, this place can be kind of hard to find but when you do you won't regret it!  The noodles are delicious although the chicken wasn't the best we really liked the shrimp. Also the pork dumplings!
5 There's something to be said for Pizza and Bagels, but in my opinion, Chinatown is the real gem of New York City.  I wanted to eat everything, everywhere, but when we finally did settle down at a spot, I know we made the right choice.  On the end of a windy street, this tiny place was packed.  Three women ran it, turning tables quickly. They are cash only, luckily there is a Chase bank just around the corner. Tea arrived promptly at our tables, and was served in styrofoam cups.  We ordered the chicken vegetable dumplings, and pan fried beef noodles. The dumplings were cooked perfectly, crispy brown on one side.  Split between the two of us, we both left very satisfied!
2 When my uncle decided to come here spontaneously for dinner one night, I was excited because I had wanted hand pulled noodles and have been looking at yelp at this location in particular. Given its 1000+ reviews with an average of 4 stars - I had high expectations. Firstly, I have eaten in plenty of hole-in-the-wall places (as they are my favorite.) However, I was disappointed by how small and crowded this space was. Also, what really irked me was the fact that there was a couple at a table that was meant for 6+ people. It was also prime dinner time so there was a slight wait too. My uncle, brother and I decided to sit at an open table that was basically meant for 2 but we managed to squeeze in - rather uncomfortably, might I say. All while the couple sitting at the 6 people table stared at us... Unbelievable.  The food on the other hand was good. I got the beef stew with hand pulled noodles and the broth was very good. My uncle ordered the dumplings and it was good too. We enjoyed our food, but given the noodles and dumplings were good (read: the same as almost anywhere in Chinatown) next time, we would forgo this place. There is another hand pulled noodle in the area where you do not have to pay gratuity and have a better seating area.
4 OMG AMAZING!!!!!!  Needed some good cheap asian food and I got the Duck wide handpulled noodle and it was great. The texture of the handpulled noodles was perfect, nice and chewy. You can also see that the noodle maker was making it fresh per order, stretching and cutting the noodles per order! I also loved that they had cilantro on the table that you scoop as much as you want in it and I put a ton since I love cilantro. This place is also super cheap and well worth it since you really do get full afterwards. Watch out, it is cash only!
5 Noodles with the perfect amount of fresh, bouncy, chewiness. I enjoyed their beef noodle soup: great broth and the noodles were definitely in the spotlight, and the meat was pretty good. Huge portions for $8!   Note that this is your typical "hole-in-the-wall" Chinatown restaurant, and there are not that many seats available. People come here for the food, not to impress a date with a romantic, upscale ambience.   Cash only.
1 The food is too damn salty. How can you soak your beef and chicken in salt? I had to throw away my food. Avoid at all cost.
2 the noodles and dumplings were definitely missing any type of enjoyable bite and chew you would associate with scratch made dough.  the broth and stir fry lacked any real flavor and was very one note.  the duck on top of my pan friend noodles were room temperature, chewy, and gummy.  if a lo mein from a decent chinese takeout is a 6/10, then the pan friend noodles from here were a 6.7.    as i was eating i kept asking myself, why did i go out of my way to come to china town, to a sit down restaurant, for decent lo mein?  why is a shop that makes noodles by hand only producing slightly upgraded lo mein?   this place needs to cook their noodles less, roll their dumpling skins slightly thicker and vastly improve their base flavors.  they also really need to re-name their 'pan fried noodles' to 'slightly better lo mein', cause that's all it is.   2 stars for the cheap price though.
4 Great food, space and presentation was a little sub par, but other than that I loved this place. It felt authentic and original. Staff was nice. Price was also good, for manhattan dining. Could be a little more clean and organized. Only reason why it is not 5 stars.
2 I wanted to love this place. The staff is kind, warm and helpful. But the food was just not good. The broth was bland, the meat was not high quality and the tea was weak. The vegetable dumplings were quite good, though. Also, the styrofoam cups and plates made me sad for the environment.
3 This place is good. Just good.  The ambiance is a little scary. Like a run down Asian mafia. Lots of old Asian men eating and speaking in various languages. Staff wasn't exactly friendly.  Food was good. Nothing to write home about.
4 Small hole in the wall and great food. The staff was nice . The food was wonderful and a great price.  They do not take credit cards  Could watch them making the noodles in the back impressive. Service was good at first and tapered off never offered us water had to ask for more tea and bill. Once you get your food they never see if you need anything else
4 I like the place, is cozy and comfortable , l love fresh made hand pull noodle !  Over all pretty good, you really can't ask too much, when I have good service and good food. Usually I am happy :)
4 A small hole in the wall restaurant, cash only.  Their specialty is hand pulled noodles.  I ordered the noodle soup #1 special which has a fried egg, ox tail, tripe, and flank.  Pretty good albeit a little salty.  What I like is that there is an ample portion of spinach and bok choy included with the dish. Total cost with tax and without tip: $9. Ample portion sizes.  FYI the restaurant actually has a basement as well with extra seating in case the front room is too crowded.
2 The noodle is ok but the soup.... I don't know how much MSG did they put in the soup. After I had the noodle, I felt so thirsty for the whole afternoon. That is the reason I gave 2*. Otherwise I would give 3*.  Like another reviewer wrote, this hand pulled noodle is just ok. You found a lot of this shop in Flushing, NY that could do much better job.
5 SO YUMMY!  I had the beef hand-pulled noodles, and the broth was amazing.
5 I went there at 10:30am when they open but had to wait for the chef to arrive. Ordered a plate of stir fried spinach and beef with knife shaved noodle. The portions are huge and the taste is clean. I would go there again but not that early!
3 The restaurant is very tiny, dirty, cables hanging from the wall, the kitchen can be seen from the tables but that's not something you want to see, I can assure you that. Bathroom is in the middle of the restaurant ... you open the bathroom door and you are in the middle of the sitting area!!! Crazy! Waiters hardly spoke any English and maybe because of that I felt they were a little anti social tending to impolite. The food was decent tasting, very good value for the money but none of the dishes I tried were outstanding. I would not go back.
4 Price has gone up over the years but you can't really complain. Quality have remained consistent throughout the years. Staff are quick and efficient. I would say it's a good place to go to if you're already in the area and the line isn't long. Dumplings do have thicker skin but I believe that is a regional style. Try to snag a table, don't feel shy about sharing one with a stranger, and remember to utilize the soy sauce and hot sauce!
4 Not bad worth the wait. Def will see people eating dumplings outside, inside, on cars and on the steps this summer.CASH ONLY. Know what you want! The waiting area, counter and pickup is one area and is quite tight. People tend to get their food and hover over or around you, usual if you are use to spot like these if not, *kanye shrug.   If you're hungry, cheap date, low on cash, drunk, hung over or something- then go.
3 Vanessa's Dumplings in Chinatown has available seating for about 20-30 guests. When I visited this place, there were about two hundred thousand people waiting for dumplings altogether. Somehow within that mass they were able to stuff about a thousand of those folks indoors while the remainder waited in a line out the door, out the block, out the damn borough.   So you can imagine how it gets a little crowded in here.   In all, it took about a couple of days for my position in line to move from DUMBO just before the Manhattan bridge to, finally, the interior of the place and up to the register. I don't necessarily mind the long wait, since I work remotely and I was able to get a lot done those two days, but I could see why the wait might be a problem for other visitors. I was able to step inside a little sooner than I thought because as someone was trying to leave, they shot out of the highly-pressurized dumpling restaurant with the velocity of a Renaissance-era cannonball, decapitating and instantly killing the person in line in front of me. Woo hoo!  A word of warning, make sure you have a general idea what you want to order, and also be sure you have cash on hand, as they charge a minimum for card transactions. If you hesitate for too long on your order, or if you need to step outside to use the ATM, then it's back to DUMBO for you baby!   Anyway, I stepped inside, and unfortunately for me a group of seven also tried to get into the place. You know the type, they've been waiting for a train for like ever, and even though there's clearly no room on the car they're going to stuff themselves in there anyway, holding the door open all the while and damned if we're gonna hold up anyone else's commute. Well, their group was about three too many for the max capacity of the room, so something had to give.  As I was perusing the menu, I felt myself flatten under the weight and pressure of everyone else waiting for dumplings. I turned out okay and luckily I didn't lose my place in line, as a good Samaritan ahead of me assisted me in peeling myself off the floor like a cartoon character who just got bowled over by a steam roller. Turns out I'm now half a millimeter thinner than their menus!  As I am now two-dimensional, it was a lot easier for the rest of us to move freely about the place. The staff at Vanessa's sure don't miss a beat despite the long lines out their door, so I was able to get my order surprisingly fast. Luckily I was able to escape the compressed restaurant before even more people tried to stuff themselves inside, compressing to the point of critical mass and creating a whole other universe aside the one you and I inhabit.  I tried pork and chive dumplings, chicken and chive, and an order of fried pork buns. They were okay, and I liked the buns a little more, but I'm not sure if it was worth the fact that I can now be blown about literally wherever the wind takes me.
1 Terrible dumplings. Obviously made by people who have never made dumplings before just to scam unbeknowing white people.
1 Food poisoning. Nuff said! Husband and I got their pork dumplings and chicken dumplings and both of us ended up with nasty cases of food poisoning. I'm throwing out a packet of their frozen dumplings as we speak. Never again.
3 I love dumplings, so when I was hungry and in the area my friend suggested we stop here.  Walking inside it was insanely chaotic, everybody crowded around the counter where they give you the food.  The register is towards the back, I had a hard time seeing it at first with the crowd in the way.  I ordered pork and chive fried dumplings and the spicy wontons...total was around $7 so very cheap for NYC in my opinion.  It took forever to get my food...it was to the point where people behind me were getting their orders and I was still standing there waiting.  Not the biggest deal but I guess I expected it to be a bit quicker.  The food was good, don't get me wrong, but it wasn't amazing, definitely nowhere near the best dumplings I've had in the city.  I wish the fried pork dumplings had been crispier, the skin was really thick and chewy but not at all crispy.  The wontons were good, just not quite as flavorful as I had hoped.  The seating area was really small, not unusual for Chinatown. There were a ton of people in there and very few tables and chairs so we had to fight for a table...probably a better idea to take it to-go.  Service isn't super friendly but the ladies behind the counter seem to work really hard so I can definitely let that go.  Overall I think this is a solid place to stop if you want cheap dumplings and you just so happen to be right there next to the restaurant.  If not, there are better places in Chinatown you can go.
2 All the hype and excitement, only to find a piece of plastic in my soup.. insert sad music here.  Super excited to try out the place, based on reviews and photos.  Ordered the chive dumplings and a hot and sour soup. They told me that they only had chive potstickers so I happily said ok.  It may have been that it was a carry out order, and that my train back to Brooklyn was another 15 minutes, but I was not impressed.  The skin was much too thick, the filling much too little. I tasted no chive flavor.  Hot and sour soup was amazing!! Lots of flavor and loaded with fresh ingredients. Three spoonfuls in, however, I bit into something that I thought was just a bone. I spit it out to take a look, and it was a hard piece of plastic!!!  ....pass. I'll go to one of the other dumpling shops just steps away.
5 Exactly what you want in Chinatown!  Great Dumplings (assorted was a wonderful choice), Bun, and Hot and Sour Soup.  Incredible, almost unbelievable pricing and a staff that is powerful and efficient.  Not much in the way of seating but that adds to the atmosphere.  If you end up in NYC, this place is definitely worth a stop.  You can get a lot of food for a little cash so be aware that Credit Card use has a $15 minimum.
2 Two stars bc the staff is very friendly. But O-M-G the food is BAD. It's cheap but not very good you get what you pay for! The dumplings are thick not evenly stuffed and they don't cook them well i ordered two different orders of dumplings with two different ticket numbers and they were both just as bad. The hot and spicy wontons were flavorless. You're better off getting the generic dumplings from any Chinese restaurant in nyc to be frank. I let myself get convinced into trying this place with the awesome pictures and rave reviews but it's all a lie. But in the end you only lose about 3 dollars per order of dumplings so try it out for yourselves and you will see I am not exaggerating.  Pro: cheap Con: bad food
4 In my quest for the most delicious dumplings. Vanessa's was a great experience. The ladies cookong work their butts off.   There is alot of variety here.   As for the dumplings it was a different texture then the other place.  This dumpling had a thicker batter which was ok. But I enjoy the thinner wrapper.  The flavors here were good though.  I got the pork and chive boiled dumplings. And I also got the spicy wontons.  The spicy wontons where really good and very spicy with a dark red chilli sauce and cilantro.  I enjoyed them better then the dumplings because the wrapper was thinner.  I would ask for the chili sauce on the side next time so I could control the heat.  I think this was my second favorite. But a very close second to the other place I can't pronounce lol.
4 I can understand why some people dislike Vanessa's Dumpling House. It's loud, it's chaotic, and if you're at the front of the line and don't have your mind made up on what you want to order, you're going to quickly attract some ugly glares from others.  On the other hand, if you come prepared and know what to expect, you're in for a great tasting budget bite. I visited Vanessa's Dumpling House during my stay at Hotel on Rivington a few blocks down. Around 2:00pm, there was a line when I arrived, but it wasn't more than a 10 minute wait before I was able to put in my order. If you're not sure what to order, I'd highly recommend the scallion pancake with pork, and one of their many types of potstickers.   Seating is limited so don't be surprised if you have to wait around for a while for a table to clear up. It seems like most people take the food to go, so again, just come with the right expectations and you won't be disappointed.
1 I don't usually write reviews,but this place deserves a negative comment because everything I had there was TERRIBLE (except for the homemade soy milk)   The dumplings had really thick skin and little filling, wasn't seasoned well neither. They didn't taste very fresh, they probably pre-make them. The only attractive thing is the price. But I'd rather spend a little more at a decent place, instead of wasting pennies on poorly made dumplings.
5 The real deal! Fast, cheap, good, AND healthy?! Unbeatable.  Steamed veggie dumplings are just filling enough and guilt-free. They're so good I'd never bother with fried.  Seating is limited, so you may need to get your food to-go and eat in the park nearby.
4 Great value and taste. Perfect for a quick bite. The food was surprisingly good for the price, and the place was crowded but we did manage to snag a table.
3 Vanessa's dumplings was a L to say the least, bit into the dumpling and tasted mostly yeast. Meat eater options dominated the menu, boiled dumplings will be your downfall if you let it in you. If you stop here make sure your dumplings are fried, your sure to enjoy if that's all you try!
3 Didn't come here for the dumplings, surprisingly - I think there are way better and cheaper options elsewhere in Chinatown.   However, I was a big fan of the sesame pancakes stuffed with your choice of protein. I got it with Peking duck, which made for a hearty breakfast. I wish mine had been served a bit hotter as it was barely lukewarm by the time they called my number.  Minimal seating and will definitely be packed on the weekends. Skip the bubble tea too - my milk tea was about 75% milk with barely any taste of the tea left.
1 Seriously? I went with high expectation because of the high review for this place. I ordered pork dumplings. As somebody who grew up in China, these dumplings are nothing similar to what we had at home. The skin was too thick and the meat slipped out so easily. You can take a good bite of both of the skin and the meat for well made dumplings. Also, the meat was not juicy and flavored at all. I had to pour so much of the black sauce and it still couldn't save it!! The sauce almost tasted like water... Also tried their peking duck and roasted pancakes. The meat had no taste and the pancake was too greasy.  This is a place for tourists. If you want authentic dumplings, there are better places in the area.
2 Wasn't crazy about the dumplings here at all.  The 2 stars are for price and for service. Won't be back
3 This is my second time enjoying Vanessa's dumplings in my lifetime. Def a dumpling fan and they have great prices and tasty dumplings. I got the fried pork and chive dumplings as well as the assorted dumplings and soup. The soup was horrible....the dumplings were overcooked and the soup broth wasn't tasty. The dumplings fried and boiled were good. The service was so so, not very friendly and the cashier is pretty rude. There's a few seats catch them if you can.
2 Although I never have high expectations going into a restaurant based solely on reviews, I had a general expectation of having decent dumplings here. I would have to say that I was quite disappointed. We ordered an array of vegetable and meat dumplings both pan fried and boiled along with spicy sauce. The dumplings and sauce were not as flavorful as I had expected them to be. I had to douse them in soy sauce and watered down sriracha. The filling in the dumpling was falling out and the dumpling dough was very thick and unpalatable. My lychee iced tea tasted overly sweet and artificial as well. Perhaps my experience was just an unlucky one seeing the positive reviews regarding this place.
1 Really bland hot and sour soup. Sesame pancake is more like a fried piece of bread. Dumplings-especially boiled, have thick chewy wrappers. Does not live up to the hype imo.
3 Hidden gem in China town- 2$ dumplings and 4.5 for veggie dumplings. Fresh and tasty.  Downside kinda grimy/dirty vibe.
3 Pretty good and super affordable dumplings. I really gave the place 3 stars because of the affordability of everything on the menu. I actually prefer the sesame pancake sandwiches over the dumplings. I am vegetarian so my options are obviously limited here, however, I had hoped for more flavor in the dumplings and they are just okay and you really need the dipping sauce for them. I wished they made potsticker versions of the veggie dumplings. The soy milk is pretty good.   The place is pretty small, you are better off ordering to take out since it gets packed quickly especially around lunch and dinner times.   Also, it's a typical Chinese hole in the wall so don't expect fantastic service. In general, you get what you pay for.
3 I came here for dumplings because of all reviews but honesty I don't get it. It was alright but not 5 star awesome. Sesame sandwich was blah, steamed dumplings blah, and only deep fried pork dumpling was decent.   Very little place to sit.   Bathroom was gross and there's a key to get in. It's attached to this nasty orange metal bar that clearly is not labeled as key.
2 Flavor was very bland. The dumplings were more flour then filling, hot & sour soup was hardly sour at all. Maybe it's because we're from ORANGE County in CA and so spoiled with all the great asian restaurants, but we were really disappointed after trying this place from all the great reviews
4 Really really cheap dumplings...Came on a Saturday and we waited a little bit for tables. (It can be crowded at times. Seems like a lot of tourists stop there for food).   I have to say I had high expectations for fried dumplings but they were alright. The four star goes to sesame pancakes with Peking Duck! Those were really good and the duck meat inside was cooked just about right. We also ordered wonton with spicy sauce. I recommend that as well.
1 Oh man this was so disappointing. No idea why this attracts so many people. There's so many other places in Chinatown with WAY better dumplings, buns and soups. I got the vegetable dumplings in spicy chili oil, and a steam vegetable bun. The dumplings looked amazing when they were ready, very pleasing to the eye and I couldn't wait to try it, but the flavor was such a let down. Nothing going on in them, so lacklustre, so bland. The vegetable bun was just a shame compared to other Chinatown bakeries. It was like plastic texture and barely any filling, and the filling itself was not tasty. I guess this appeals to people who don't try the smaller local spots. But you sure are missing out if you think these are the best dumplings and buns around. Big time.
3 This place is your normal hole in the wall Chinese restaurant near Chinatown. I got the 8 veggie dumplings and it tasted like someone had forgotten to add salt. There was no flavor whatsoever. Really disappointed, but it's ok.  I did like the soybean milk. There's barely any sugar and it's very authentically Chinese.   I also got a dish that I assumed would be like a fried pancake, but it was a thicker doughier pancake sandwich which took me by surprise.   The environment is pretty dirty and dingy. There's barely any seating and you might have to fight for seats on the weekend but people leave pretty fast.
5 Yum so good and so authentic. Like the area too.  I got the combo order and totally loved it.  I had to force myself to finish but I knew i would regret it since dumplings don't save well.
5 I've been craving some dumplings for awhile now and this place had good reviews so I gave it a shot. The restaurant was on a typical dirty Chinatown street. Once I saw the storefront I felt better about my choice. The inside was nice but had very limited seating. The dumplings were homemade, and the best I have ever had! I tried an assortment with the house spicy sauce. The people beside me were talking about how good it was. Great prices too!
5 So underrated! Prices are roughly less than $5 and are very tasty. We got a full meal for 3 people for just $30. They got bubble teas too but it was just average. The star of the show is boiled dumpling (chicken & shrimp) with spicy sauce! Highly recommend this place, will definitely come back
4 Super cute place. The Fried dumplings are delicious...even my husband who doesn't like dumplings (wtf, I know) couldn't stop eating them.   The steamed dumplings are good too & you can't beat the price.
3 So I read a lot of reviews about this place and most reviews said the dumplings and the buns were good. And yes, they were right. We ordered the pan fried pork dumplings and the pork sesame buns with a side order of the chili oil. All were very very good.   The reason I gave 3 stars is because of the customer service and cleanliness. The place was really dirty. The floors had a lot of garbage, the tables were not clean and some areas had gunk. If the place looks like that, I can't imagine how the conditions are when they are prepping these dumplings. Second, when we were trying to order, the gentleman working didn't look at us or attempt to take our order. He told us to hold on. During the awkward moment, he was just looking for a cord to plug his phone into. Its hard for me to explain because you had to be there but it was very odd when the guy was talking to us, it felt like we were talking to a recording or robot. It was very unwelcoming.  This stuff rarely bothers me but crap..if you want our money, be courteous and act like you care.
5 Always glad this place exists when I'm in the East Village and hungry.   Everything is made fresh, and the prices cannot be beat. A few dollars will get you a few orders of pan fried dumplings and one of their incredible hot sesame pancakes for a delicious filling meal. Their housemade chili oil is especially excellent, and their vegetable dumplings are so full of fresh vegetables that you can almost pretend they're healthy. You can also buy cheap bags of frozen dumplings to take home.  The place is always busy, so it can sometimes take a while for them to make your order, but it's well worth it. Highly recommend a visit when you're stopping at Trader Joe's or about to catch the 3rd Ave L.
5 Will kill for this. The pancakes are amazing and the sweet and sour soup. Heard from some people that the beef noodle soup is a steal.
3 I searched for scallion pancakes in yelp in the area and found Vanessa's. Not sure why it showed up since it did not have any. However, decided to try it because of the numerous reviews and the high ratings.   I ordered a ton of stuff. Fried chive pork dumplings, fried pork and cabbage dumplings, wonton hot spicy sauce, pork fried buns, steamed red bean buns, pancake with Peking duck, pancake with roast pork, noodle with meat and bean sauce, green apple tea, strawberry green tea and almond smoothie with lychee and a chive and egg pancake. All added up to just $35. The best thing had to be the wontons and the sesame pancakes. The drinks were excellent too. However, the dumplings were just ok. The steamed red bean bun was cold as was the chive and egg pancake.   The place was full of young white people with half of them being foreigners. I guess word gets out that it's cheap. Then I was a little freaked out by the Family of druggies who came in to use the bathroom. It was about 9 on a Monday night and the place was packed. Definitely not a place to come if you plan on a nice slow dinner.   I'm not sure I would recommend this place. The service was friendly. But overall, it was just ok overall.
4 Great little place to grab a quick bite to eat. Always fresh noodles and sauces.  Had the peanut noodles(a special), vegetables dumplings and beef soup noodles. Very light, tasty and homey.   Don't expect a great ambiance or white glove service but do expect awesome food, friendly atmosphere and hearty meals. Will definitely revisit.
5 Super affordable and delicious as well! What else can I ask for!? Four large fried dumplings for less than $2 and roasted duck filling pancake. Oh the sesame pancake crispy outside and soft inside, sweet and savory black sauce, the juicy and tender roasted duck, along with refreshing cucumber and Peking scallion: deliciousness! Large portion and I am sure you will fill up within $10 or even $5!
4 All the tourist love China Town, and the New Yorker's avoid the fake Rolex capital of the world just about as much as we avoid Times Square. If you HAVE to see China Town, avoid eating at one of the tourist traps on Canal street and take a short detour down the street to grab some amazingly cheap and delicious dumplings!  For about $3 you can get a decent snack, and for $6 have a nice size lunch! These are not the best dumplings I've ever had, but they are damn good and hit the spot. With low prices, grab a wide variety of things from the menu and share with friends.   Good place to bring a group and sit inside, not a lot of tables but worth a pit stop.
3 Very very friendly staff... never been before so I asked the counter person what was best. She said, let me order for you and I agreed. We had dumplings and sandwiches on some sesame pancakes or whatever. They were both very good, very fresh and very inexpensive. Add it all together and you have the perfect lunch. I would definitely revisit. But who the heck is Vanessa??
5 Best dumplings for best price.  $5 for 8 boiled dumplings and $2.50 for 4 fried dumplings. They had amazing sesame scallion pancakes for $3.  It's always busy in there but you don't wait long. It's self service and very fast. Great food! Highly recommended!
4 Found this place after my failed experience with Dimsum at chinatown! Had ordered variety of dumplings. #1,7,8, and 11! Pork bun was good and others were as good too! The wait was pretty long, the food wait time was about 15 minutes, the fried dumplings were warm because it was sitting behind the counter for 5 minute while preparing boiled dumplings, but other than that, good experience!
4 Stopped in as tourists, and the dumplings were really good for the price--8 for $4! Will stop in again if we visit NYC again.
4 Everything here is good and cheap, and it's kind of fun to order an absurd amount of food and have your bill come out to be only $20. It's pretty informal. You flag someone's attention and order at the counter and hope that there is a table open for you to sit at. Nothing glamorous and totally fine.  I have tried every dumpling here and can confidently say that they are all excellent. Order whichever meat you personally enjoy the most as they are not known for one specific dish or anything here: all is good.  Their other options are satisfactory, but not amazing. However, if you are in the mood for clean, Asian flavors, it hits the spot.  In addition to their dumpling varieties, I've had the Wonton noodle soup and Peking duck sandwhiches which were both pretty tasty. The sandwhich was a but dry, but I loved the noodle soup because they give you a healthy sized portion of those fat noodles I love.  I really like these cheap little hole-in-the-wall Chinese places in NY, and need to visit more and more often. I will update you!
3 Ok spoiler alert I am Asian. I love Asian food. I know Asian food. I am not someone who is an Asian food snob, but I know when I'm getting duped. So let's talk price. NYC YOU CHEAP HERE and that is a beautiful thing. 4 dumplings for under 2 bucks. Ok I can get behind that. I got the pork dumplings and they were good. Not great. Also not saturated with grease which is huge. Perfectly steamed and pan fried. I was very happy with the outside. The inside was fine, nothing crazy special. I got the dumpling soup, which was also fine. I was very very happy with how not-greasy the broth was. Clear as day. Was it spectacular? No. Was it worth the price? Absolutely. Super fast, terrible service (sorry, that's what happens in Asian restaurants. In and out guys, in and out.) my whole meal was 5 bucks for a light lunch.   Best dumplings in the city? Nah. Was I overimpressed? Nah. But for the price, sure let's go at least once.   What to try: known for their dumplings.   Water rating: N/A
5 I LOVE their assorted dumplings and chicken (or duck) pancakes!! So fucking amazing. I absolutely love this place probably my FAVORITE dumpling place in the city. Both locations are quality.
3 Really torn about this review because I have been coming here since my middle school days..   If I were to review Vanessa's 10 years ago, it would've definitely been 5 stars without a doubt.. even 5 years ago, I would still probably give it 5 stars. I get that prices go up with popularity and all else however today when I went for lunch I was shocked to see the new prices for just fried dumplings. Remember the days when everyone was broke but had enough for dumplings? $1 for 5 pieces- those were the days I miss most about these dumpling spots. Prices today for the same dumplings and probably not as good- 1.75 for 4 pieces. The fact that you're paying more for less.. I get it but I'm not sure how justified that is. I remember the days when a wonton soup was $1.50- now, $2.50- something i can definitely skip on! I understand that this price increase doesn't affect most people as it is still deemed as cheap and tasty however for someone who's frequent this spot for a decade now, if I do not crave it enough, I would choose other lunch options as opposed to coming here.   Today for lunch I ordered wontons with spicy sauce and sesame pancake. Total for two of each was $13.50. One order of wontons came with 8 pieces along with their spicy sauce which (I think) included, garlic sauce, chili oil. chili flakes and cilantro. Though I must admit it was really good, it was $5.50 per order. I guess it's okay though I think the price point is a little steep. Their sesame pancakes are how I remember it to be so no complaints there. $1.25 a piece but super filling.   The workers here, half are nice but the rest seems to be annoyed to serve anyone at all. I would assume, with the price increase on their entire menu that customer service should be decent. This place is a solid in terms of taste but overall considering the price and service- 3.5/5
1 Biggest regret to go here. Im a foodie and I went to a hell of snow storm to get here. I got treated so disrespected and rude. They acted like I couldn't afford food attitude. Foods are worst than frozen or can foods. Everything are so bland. Even their popular "spicy sauce wonton" are all spicy oily chilis. Nothing was good. I ordered a few varieties of things to test it out. Do not recommend any foodies or anyone to waste their time. My friend couldn't even finish her sesame pancake with egg even after soy sauce and alot siracha. Their soymilk taste like warm water only smell a little bit of soybean. Their price are little cheap but again worst than a frozen dumpling or wonton quality. All of my order(forgot veggie bun) in the pictures cost $20.
4 I'm surprised I never had or heard of this place. I don't live in the city so when I am out there at my friends we like to eat. I like trying new spots so he suggested Vanessa's also bc it is fairly cheap compared to other spots.  Not much seating in there and it was packed so we got to the order counter and I didn't have much time to order because we were in a rush to get somewhere else so I tried the pork friend dumplings which were good and the shredded beef sesame pancake which had so much flavor  With a Snapple it was about $7 and more food then I even needed.  I am definitely coming back and ordering a ton more when I don't have anything to do after and can just take some of this home and eat on couch.
4 My office staff order lunch from here at least once a week because the food is tasty and substantial for a low price. I feel this food is oily but this is the nature of the beast. Fried dumplings? Fried pancakes? Sandwiches in a fried crispy outer sesame bread? Even the delicious sauces have a significant amount of oil. But it's a nice treat once a week. We order a lot.
5 I just want to know who Vanessa is, so I can thank her for helping me survive these broke times. Dumplings are delicious! Get the pork and chive! If I'm really hungry I'll get dumplings and a vegetable sesame pancake. Their bubble tea leaves me bubbly. I usually get the Thai milk iced tea, but I decided to get out my comfort zone and try the coconut milk bubble tea. It's creamed perfection.
4 There are a lot of options for Chinese food in this one single restaurant. It's just the exactly kind of feeling when you walked into a dumpling restaurant in China. Their food is close to real Chinese food but I would suggest please don't use so many plastic plates and bowls. It will look better if they use plates instead of plastic ones. Overall it's good food and good experience. Kinda crowded, you probably have to wait a little. It's definitely a good place for college students to grab a quick cheap good meal in the city. Would like to visit again if I cross nearby.
5 Best dumplings in the city! Queue can get big sometimes but wait and try the spicy soup dumplings- worth the wait. Their bubble teas suck though- too much ice.
4 We were craving dumplings really badly on a Saturday morning so we came to handy yelp and found this place. It's a solid 4 stars. I was a little disappointed in finding myself thinking of my local Chinese food spots dumplings while being here. But it's prob all the crap that's in those that I love so much! Now, that scallion pancake they use for the sandwich, YUM!! Once again, the meat was a little bland for me but maybe I just need some getting used to. I would happily return for a second shot. The girl at the register was super sweet! Oh! And DO NOT get the green tea with milk. Ughh tasted like detergent if that's even a taste.
5 Get the sesame pancake w duck!!! Oooomg All dumplings are delicious and the food comes out quickly.
4 Vanessa's is great spot for dumplings, pork buns and sesame pancakes. My husband and I went there on a rainy afternoon and ordered chive & pork and basil & chicken fried dumplings, pork fried buns, and a roasted beef sesame pancake, all for less than $10. It definitely gets crowded but we were able to snag a table. This is definitely a no frills place but the food is delicious!
3 Very bland. Doughy which could be something you like? We have good dumplings  in Pa and at Vanessa's they are just ok. We went out of our way to get here while in NYC after reading and watching reviews. The chive pancake had flavor so get that if you give in and go to  Vanessa's. My feeling is if you have decent dumplings where you live, or don't like very doughy dumplings, skip it. If you're from NYC then these might be the best, cheapest, and the cleanest place to get them in the city.
2 The only good thing I found about this place is that it's really unexpensive. Had some fried dumplings and boiled dumplings, but they had no flavor AT ALL. There's little space to sit, and the long wait is just not worth it. Also, you have to go with cash if you're not buying $15 minimum, which is inconvenient to say the least. I'm not sure about the rest of the menu, but the dumplings were just disappointing.
5 I have come here sooo often as it was literally steps from my apartment (lived in one of the tenements of LES) and witnessed it as it became more and more popular over time. The place itself doesn't feel clean, and there's no concept of service; you get a number and wait by the counter with many others, but you come here for the affordable and delicious food.   I used to love the picked cucumber they sold in containers that you could pick up from the fridge, I tried the kimchi but it was bad, so I never purchased it again.   The wonton in chili sauce / 红油抄手 for 5 bucks was always my favorite and no one else seemed to get it when I frequented the place, but I still have yet to find a place that does this so well in LA. Just something about the women that work here that I respect so much, women who would put the handmade dumplings into the water to boil them once the order was placed and check on them often until they were done. The dumplings were perfectly seasoned with hot oil and chives and were steamy when I had them on my table.  Get the sesame pancake with a fried egg - makes it extra delicious. I'd recommend getting the pork and chive dumplings for a dollar, devour them after putting sriracha sauce and soy sauce on them. Not sure if the price increased since I left, but they are good. If you want better dumplings, I'd go to Prosperity Dumpling but I just found out it's closed, so sad. All these great establishments disappear into thin air. For the record, Prosperity Dumpling offered the cheapest and the most savory Chinese dumplings I've had and I loved the thin skin the joint offered unlike the one @ Vanessa's. I digressed but I love Vanessa's and hope the business stays in the neighborhood for a long time.
4 Fried pork/chive dumplings were delicious! Also tried the pork bun...very good. Fast and friendly service. This place looks like it's always crowded and the seats fill up fast!
5 Why is this place so good?? Kept hearing good things and glad I finally got to try it. Was just stopping in for a small bite to eat while we waited for a table at a nearby restaurant. Only split 4 dumplings with my friend, but they were so good! It was less than $2. We got the pan fried pork and cabbage dumplings. The dough is crispy from the pan and just the right amount of chewiness. The meat inside is good too and clearly homemade. Want to go back and try their chili oil dumplings and pan fried pork buns. Minimal seating as expected, but really can't complain. Food comes out very fast - short wait time.
5 This is my favorite spot on the lower east side! Great array of dumplings and entrees to pick from. I spent $6 and got a good amount of food - I was stuffed afterwards. Sometimes the line looks long, but usually the wait for your food is 8-15 minutes max. Not a lot of seating, so would recommend getting it to go for more than 2 ppl. Cash only!
1 Really, *really* lousy food. If you know what Chinese street food is supposed to taste like, stay away. I sampled:   * northern Chinese-style beef sandwich: adequate but unimpressive, and comparable to what you get in other places around Chinatown;  * basil and chicken dumplings: no basil visible or tastable;  * noodles in a sauce of meat and preserved beans: doughy, overcooked noodles in a canned sauce with no evidence of meat.  There is decent food in Chinatown at this price point, but you won't find it at Vanessa's. This was just gross, and I'll never go back.
5 Vanessa is our hot spot for the city. You never go wrong! The prices are astounding for what you are served. The dumplings are soft, fresh and just yummmyyyy! I am hooked to their steamed vegetable dumplings The place is always always super busy. Their chilli sauce is a killer.  If you are craving some real dumplings, bookmark this spot !
1 They're so rude. The vegetable dumplings were not good at all. I don't see what all the hype is about.
5 Cheap, authentic, and delicious, Vanessa's is perhaps the most American-friendly low end dumpling house in the city. I used to live a few blocks away, and would cash in on 4/$1 pork and chive dumplings and sesame pancakes with veggies on a weekly basis. Always hot and fresh! Plus, I much prefer the east side location to the union square one. It feels more authentic and cozy, being on the edge of china town. Check it out! Pro tip: speak loudly and clearly when ordering, and pay attention to the numbers called. The staff will appreciate it, especially considering the slight language barrier. They don't mess around at Vanessa's!
5 This place doesn't have a ton of seating, but that's pretty much the only knock. The dumplings are delicious, and you have to try the sesame pancake sandwiches. The bread is perfect, and they have all kinds of fillings to choose from. Everything here is so cheap that you can leave stuffed for $5-6. Will be back!
3 Cheap dumplings, but were low quality. I would come here again to eat cheap food, but nothing else. The place was too crowded and the bubble tea was too sweet. The vegetable dumplings were nasty. The workers here were friendly though.
4 Atmosphere - very small, fast paced, great people watching AND if you don't mind sharing your table... this is the place to eat dumplings in Chinatown. Customer service - typical for this kind of place, nothing special but not horrible either... ok, let's get to the food!!!!  The spicy pork or chicken boiled dumplings are OUT OF THIS WORLD!!!  The spice is just right, nothing to over powering and the meat is very tender.  I'd give the food 5 stars for the dumplings.  Go with an open mind and order a few things, I can promise you won't be let down.  Also, I didn't have this but the gentleman that sat at my table did, pancake w Peking duck and it looked and smelled very good!  I've read several good reviews about that as well.  Enjoy!!
5 NEVER FAILS. Its a ton of food for under $10 and its always great and filling. I've only ever tried the steamed buns, sesame pancakes and dumplings. Don't know about anything else on the menu but these three items are my go to. Customer service sucks but I'll deal with it for a $6 meal and leftovers for the next day.
5 How could I not discover this place earlier?! Very cheap, huge menu, hearty food. I had pork dumplings with chives and a scallion kimchi dough sandwich for lunch for under $7! The soup is pretty good too. The best part is watching the cooks prepare the food. Cash only and seats fill up quickly so choose your hours. Wait can get a bit longer depending on which dish you order. One thing quite odd is I couldn't find the soy sauce anywhere...
4 Tasty dumplings, horrible customer service, but at a price this cheap does it even really matter?    I've gotten the vegetable dumplings here a couple times, and I'm never really disappointed. Everything is filling and good (albeit I do like to add soy sauce and sriracha), and for the price you can't beat it.
5 This is my favorite go to place when it comes to dumplings. They know exactly what they're doing. The pork fried dumplings are my absolute favorite. Just posting this review is making me want to go!
4 This place is small in terms of space and big in terms of flavor.  Came here with a friend to satiate a dumping craving. We def came to the right place.  A lot of the places in this area have similar signage and tend to blend into one another. Vanessa's, thankfully, stands out so you'll have no trouble finding it. You'll notice that the place is exceptionally small. Along the left side, you have tables. Along the right side is the counter to order/pick-up and behind that is the kitchen area. It helps if you know what you want, so make sure to look up their menu before you go or take a moment to figure it out outside if the weather isn't too extreme. Once you're ready to order, you'll move to the line by the register. There's going to be a lot of folks standing around, so make sure to ask if you're not sure where the line ends. Once you order, you'll get a receipt. Hold on to that! Your number will be called to pick up your drinks/food. Treat yourself to some bubble tea, if you're in to that sort of thing. If you want a seat, you're more than likely going to have to hover--uncomfortably--by the folks you think are most likely to leave soon. It's not ideal, but this is what you signed up for--delicious dumplings and getting close to strangers.  If you're lucky enough to get a seat, enjoy your dumplings sitting down, otherwise, you might be able to snag some bar-top space by the entrance. We tried a bunch of dumplings, but honestly the good ol' regular fried pork dumplings are the best; and they are soooooo cheap. No matter what you get though, you can't go wrong.  If I see you there, I'll be sure to eat quickly and give you my seat =)
2 This place has gone downhill. Lady at the counter was CLIPPING HER FINGERNAILS when I approached to order. And she DIDN'T STOP, even after taking 2 customers' orders. Gross.  I walked so far in the cold to get there and was hungry, I ordered anyway. Ugh. Regretting it now based on how I feel. The wonton skin is now super thick, like the kind you get when you order from a mediocre Chinese restaurant - not thin and delightful like I remember it; I'm not sure where they source their pork from, either. Meh, just meh.  I won't visit again.
4 Delicious boiled and fried dumplings, though the filling is a bit too fatty for me. But great value if you're looking for homemade dumplings. My favorite item on the menu is actually the sesame pancake filled with roasted duck. Great portion and super delicious.
4 Know what you want when you enter the restaurant and place your order with the cashier. If you wait on the sidelines watching them out together orders, your's will never come.   The pancake with duck was awesome, crispy, moist and filling. The chive and pork dumplings were great too. Others ordered soup and They offer a goood variety. Vanessa's has pan fried and steamed dumplings which are juicy and flavorful. Everything moves like clockwork and you can watch the staff cooking the dumplings.   Prices are low so you can try a variety of items but so take cash unless you plan to spend $10 or more.  There's some limited seating, so it's good to take a friend or two so you can sample a variety of dishes!  if only I could go back for more duck!  Yum-o!
5 Vanessa is one of my fav place to go when i crave for good fried dumplings. 1.75$ for 4 big homemade dumplings. Everything in the menu is very cheap. Mind that the place is not very clean, the staff is kinda rude and it's usually packed so hard to find a seat!
5 The spicy wontons in hot oil with scallions are delicious, for $5 dollars and some change it is a very filling! I come to Manhattan craving this!
3 It's cheap, I think that's what makes it so popular. Anyone can grab a couple of dumplings and for the price be satisfied with it. When I came I got a few items and it can get a bit greasy after a couple of items. Dumplings was okay, the beef wrap was decent, didn't really like the duck wrap
3 This place used to be five stars. I remember coming here as a kid where the walls had dirty white tiles and the place can only fit 6 people. It was a grab and go place. The dumplings were 5 for $1. Today when I went back, it's 4 for $1.75. I know it's cheap, but it adds up when you buy a meal (THANKS A LOT FUCKING TOURISTS). The dumplings used to to plumper and juicer. Now, is a little skinny and quality isn't as great. They raised the whole menu by .50 cents to a $1. I'm annoyed and turned off by Vanessa's. A typical meal else where ranges to $10. In order to have a full decent meal at Vanessa's my meal now costs $10. I would always come here cheap eats cause I can't afford a $10 meal (I'm a broke college student). It's such a shame.
5 Love this dumpling shop!   Fried/boiled jiaozi (dumplings) and pork-filled baozi (steamed buns) are just like those in Beijing and (if at all possible!) just as affordable in NYC!  $8 got two of us a filling lunch (sodas included).  Seating is limited, but even that rings true for a taste of true Chinese fast food experience.  Highly recommend!
5 I've been coming to Vanessa's since it was a tiny hole in the wall, with 6 stools at an old fashioned corner counter and 4 workers keeping the line of hungry customers happy. I remember when Vanessa would come in and make Tuna fish for the sesame pancakes, np one makes it quite like her, not even her sister.  I'm sure I've left a review for this place a few times but hey, I'll do it again.  Everything here is fresh, if it wasn't made to order, it was in the process of being cooked when you ordered.  The most popular thing is the fried pork dumplings and the vegetable dumplings, simply because that is the original offering.  The chicken and the shrimp ones are tasty,  but nothing beats the or original veggie  dumpling in soup with a sesame pancake.  The varieties of the pancake sando are endless as they are delicious, especially the duck and tuna.  This place is far better than the competition and I'm glad the staff still recognizes me from the old days
2 Way too much dough. And filling is only okay. Had the pork and chive dumplings both fried and boiled. And also the spicy wontons, whose filling was better. Shu jiao next door is SO SO much better.
5 I spent a week in New York City and although I didn't go to many restaurants, I will always remember this one for their delicious dumplings. It was super cold in the city and I wanted soup so a local friend of mine took me to this place because apparently the dumplings and soup are really good. I wish I took a photo of the food but it was just so good that I devoured them. I ordered the pork + chive dumplings (4 pc for $1.50) it can't get any better than that! Pretty sure I ate about 10 pieces by myself... Also, got a large hot and sour soup to share for $4 and it was a huge portion, enough to feed 3-4 people. It was probably one of the best hot and sour soups I've ever had. This place is a must go when I visit NYC again!
4 If you're looking for good, fast, cheap dumplings - look no further! The dumplings here are delicious and the staff is friendly. My friends and I came here on our last day in NY and this was one of our last stops, we were crunched for time, luckily our dumplings came out super fast.   It is NYC\China Town so just be aware that seating is limited, and this isn't a high end fancy restaurant. It's basically a fast-food Chinese dumpling spot. I would definitely come here again for a quick bite to eat.
4 Cheap but really good dumplings!!!! Can't get this price anywhere else except in China
4 Couldn't believe my eyes seeing dumplings and pancakes home made right before me and for such low prices! Stumbled across this while in search of small eats in town, and for a bathroom honestly...   This place was packed and poppin' with ages of all kind, ordering dumplings and sesame pancakes left and right. After my bathroom break, I couldn't resist but join in the line. Only catch is this place takes $15 min for credit card, so always have some cash on you!   Though the pancakes may have been described as "bland" by some, I thoroughly enjoyed it being delivered freshly made and steaming hot as you bit into the light fluffy dough. I was secretly hoping it would taste similarly to ones I've had in Tianjin or Hong Kong, but I have yet to find the same ones. Dumplings are juice and bursts right into your mouth, though the dough was slightly thicker for my preference. Overall, this place is a great stop to sample some small eats or eat a full meal with no constraint on your wallet!
5 This place is the GOAT of cheap food. It's open pretty late, so it's great as a pre-club meal. I went there with a friend and ordered two different types of dumplings; in total I had 6 dumplings to eat and it only cost $5!   This place has a $15 minimum for card, so bring cash. It can be hard to find seats, it's sort of like the Hunger Games, so you always have to be alert. They have soy sauce and Sriracha for condiments. The dumplings were freshly made, they were fried perfectly, they tasted delicious.  Vanessa's Dumpling House has never failed me and every time I'm in Chinatown, I always have to visit.
4 Some of the items on the menu were not personally for my taste but the meals are very affordable. I personally enjoyed the spicy wontons in how they were very fresh. The wonton layer was very thin and the inside had soft meatball like texture with a nice crunch of scallion/cilantro? I would definitely come for another visit to try out their other dumplings.
5 Glad we stopped off in China Town and tried this place. The dumplings are delicious and had amazing flavor. Not a lot of room to sit, but the service is fairly fast.
5 It's hard finding a place that sells food as cheap and delicious as Vanessa's Dumpling House. So far I ordered their dumplings for $1.50, hot and sour soup for $2.00, and wontons large for $4.00. Food was great and service was quick. Just note that they may not necessarily have seats when you stop by, and if they do have seats it may be a bit inaccessible due to tight spacing.
3 Quick service and good food if you're looking for something on your walk downtown or to work.
4 Service was good even though we had to wait a few minutes (maybe 10?) for them to make another batch of the pork and cabbage dumplings. One of the employees especially was really extra nice.   My spouse and I and in laws ordered chive and pork pan fried dumplings, cabbage and pork pan fried dumplings, and 2 scallion pancakes (one plain and one with roast duck). We took them back to the hotel so the fried dumplings weren't as crispy on the bottom but still delicious. I wish the skins were slightly thinner but they were still tasty. The duck bing was tasty and o loved that they included the duck skins which added a bit of the fat and lots of flavor. I preferred the pork and cabbage dumplings over the ones with chives, but that's probably a personal preference.   The price was amazing for how full we got. I think it cost us less than $13 to feed all 4 of us adults! Way to go Vanessa for such yummy food at an affordable cost!
5 Atmosphere - 3 stars. Little crowded. They are really busy so it little hard to find a seat. If u do need to go to restroom, them dint he surprise by the graffiti.    Food - 5 stars. We got dumpling and pancake. It crunchy and delicious. The dumpling was amazing, good filling and the outside wasn't too thick. The pancake was delicious, crunchy and a lot of meat. Not too much oily. Definitely recommend.   Services - 4 stars. From taking order to handing out food, they all pretty nice.
5 Such a great place to eat authentic Chinese dumplings! I loved the taste of each flavor; it reminded me of the dumplings my mom made! Thanks for the great experience!
4 This place was pretty good. The dumplings were extremely affordable, and I was able to get a sampler, wontons in hot oil, friend pork dumplings, and a coke for only $12. To me, that was an amazing deal, especially in Manhattan.  The atmosphere is a little rough though. Plenty of people tried to cut the line. It was difficult to move or get a seat. My party also witnessed a rather intense screaming match between employees. But, honestly don't let it deter you. Or alternatively, just get it to go.
4 I like the vegetabe  dumpling in soup. It was pretty  good. The texture of dumpling skin  was good and stuffing  was delicious.  The place  was crowded  but pretty  enjoyable. The portion was generous and the price was moderate.  I also tried the pancake  and  enjoyed. I want to visit   this place again in the near future.
5 Best deal in town. Seriously, we got so much food for almost nothing. The sesame pancake (which I have never had anywhere before) filled with Peking duck was one of the most delicious things I've ever tasted. The dumplings were huge and stuffed with filling. Thoroughly impressed with the quality of the dumplings for the price.   I would warn those planning on coming to this restaurant that it is right and has limited seating. We were able to grab a table but it was really tight. Definitely wouldn't recommend coming here with a large group of people.
5 Visiting my friend in Manhattan and we made a stop here. Wow. First off, this place is absurdly cheap. It should not be so cheap. But it is.   The dumplings are moist and crispy pork and chive dumplings with a tasty crispy bottom. But the think that really blew my mind was the duck and sesame pancake. It is a deep fried piece of bread that they stuff with this roasted duck. I will have fantasies about this pancake for many, many years. And so damn cheap! Will be back!
3 CASH under $15.  Ordered 4 items just to try them all and it was cheap.   Sesame bread tastes bland, could use more salt.  Pork fried buns also tasted a bit bland.  Fried dumplings were pretty good, but also somewhat bland.  Boiled dumplings were the tastiest and came HOT. Tastes better with the vinegar / soy sauce mix.  Clients are mostly non-asian so it felt less authentic. Food is average, I'm sure there are better places nearby.
4 Cheap eats! Delicious food. Would definitely recommend and go back!
5 Always delicious and inexpensive to boot. My order last night was steamed veggie dumplings and a miso soup. Fried veggie dumplings were not available but I think the steamed were better anyway. It was crowded, as always, so we ate standing up at the counter where we watched the food prep happening and the two ladies having fun and giggling over pronunciation troubles. My man was laughing at how elated this simple meal made me.
4 Super cheap dumplings along with other Chinese favorites such as wonton soup and pancake scallions. Ordering was simple enough and you take your receipt and wait. They call your number and you walk up with your receipt and take your food. It isn't exactly fast food but it's definitely quicker than just a restaurant setting.  Bring cash!! Unless you plan on ordering a tonnnn of food, I believe there is a minimum for a credit card.
4 My favorites are beef sesame pancakes, fried pork dumpling, and boiled shrimp dumpling.   Vanessa's Dumpling House is a very straightforward place:  - Get in line when you know what you want (Don't hold up the line). - Order on the cashier. Bring cash ($15 minimum). - Hold your receipt. - Wait for your order to be called out, and then walk away.   Service could be improved, though. Yet, it is the only dumpling house where I pay $5 and leave totally satisfied. Enjoy!
5 I went there during a food tour I organized for a visiting friend. We went there with two goals in mind: the (boiled) dumpling and the sesame pancake.  Both were delicious. Dumplings were ultra fresh. The rice cake (outer part of the dumpling) was fluffy and melted in the mouth. Inner part was a bit more ordinary but still good.The pancake was very good too and was a bit like an Asian pan pizza.  -Staff was not very friendly but I wasn't there for that. -Difficult to get a table at 2pm during the work week. -Service was a bit slow, considering the limited menu and cooking techniques. +Super cheap.  °Must try in china town ° Will go back with other visiting friends for sure
5 Good AND cheap food? This is the place! There are no words to describe how great this place is. A friend of mine brought me to this place a few weeks ago and ever since I've been coming back every time I'm in the area. They're known for their dumplings here and their sesame pancakes, and gotta say, this place hits all the spots!!  So far, I've tried:  -the regular Sesame pancake-  so good, crunchy, soft, hot, and sesame-y, there's scallions inside too! ($1!!!!!!)  -Sesame pancake with roasted pork-  the first thing I tried here and I knew I'd have to get more and keep coming back! Very flavorful, pork on the inside with some carrots, cilantro and scallions yumm ($3)  - boiled wontons with spicy sauce- (8) I'm not very good with spicy, but this was so good, I had to keep eating them, filled with their spicy sauce, cilantro and scallions on top, makiing this a very popular dish among this place ($5)  -pan fried dumplings (4)- full of meat and not dough, juicy and not pricey at all ($1.50)  -Sesame pancake with Roasted Beef- Tere were about 2 beef slices in there but combined with the freshly made sesame pancake, was incredibly good ($3)  - Sesame pancake with pecking duck: this was so delicious that even when I was full, I had to finish this, especially the side where its nice and crunchy and very very delicious, thinking about this makes my mouth water !( $3.5)  -Sesame pancake with Szechuan Style Beef Sauce- probably the most aromatic sesame pancake I've tasted so far! Smelled delicious, tasted even better ! ($3.5)  The amount of food you can get for the price is just not worth missing out!!!! Must try! There are always long lines, NON-STOP so come one come all!
4 I've started coming here way before this place became trendy. I used to come here during lunch time when I was in high school. Til this day, this is my go to spot if I'm craving dumplings or sesame pancake with beef but to me this place is not super delicious or special. Somehow this is just a place that's been around for so long that I'm used to going to. The food tastes good but there are places that taste even better. I guess cause it's been around for so long, I basically grew up around it, it's become part of me. The price increased but it's still affordable and filling which I like. They actually have a small section inside the city acre market in the Fidi area and the prices there is triple the price here which is ridiculous! Overall everyone should try this dumpling spot! Cause everyone comes here now for dumplings!
3 Hmmm, I was excited to try this place, but turns out the dumplings were only ok. You order at the cashier and they give you a receipt with your order number. They'll call your number when it's ready. I ordered the shrimp dumplings. It's a great price, I'll give them that. You get 8 dumplings for under $5. But the dumplings were bland, both the skin and the filling. I also didn't like the sauce it came.
1 I got food posioning from this place I will never eat from here again . I ended up in the hospital with IVs for 3 hrs on pain medicine I was sick as a dog . Stomach pains everything eat here at your own risk
4 As usual, very crowded, but we hovered and waited for a table of 7 to leave.  By the time we got our food -- dumplings and sesame pancakes -- the table was free.  The dumplings are decent and satisfying, although lacking slightly in intense flavor.  Tried the spicy shrimp/pork dumplings steamed, veggie dumplings with green skin, double order of pork pot stickers - we thought we ordered them steamed, but came fried -- oh well, that worked.  Plus the beef sesame pancake.  I think it was $15 for all.  Crazy value, it is fun to watch that crazy kitchen in action.
1 Mobbed w/ people and vastly overrated.  Mushy pork and chive filling in dumplings, soups tasteless (with horrible brown vinegar-ly filling) and an overall disappointed experience.  Yucko.
3 Value + quality food. We tried the fish ball soup, plain sesame pancake, spicy wontons, and pork and cabbage dumplings. Fish balls were on point. It has  fish flavor but it's not fishy and the consistency is just the right amount of chewiness. We had to get a second round of it. Plain sesame pancake was very good. Not too oily, crispy out the outside, chewy and soft on the inside. It did not taste doughy. The wonton with spicy sauce was just average in my opinion. The sauce didn't compare to some others.  The pork and cabbage fried dumplings were also just average. Didn't really taste the cabbage, but it was nice and juicy inside. Would definitely go back to try the noodles, hot and sour soup, and boiled dumplings!
4 Vegetable steamed bun. $1.50 Small soy milk (hot). $1.50  Very good option for a light meal or a late night munch.   Steamed bun was warm, slightly sweet, but just a little on the dry side (probably because I was there late at night). The filling is sautéed cabbage, chives, carrots, mushrooms, and bamboo shoots. Lightly salted - just right! Great vegetarian dish.  Soy milk is hot, and you get about 2.5 cups for the small size. Definitely home made (I could taste the natural sweetness of soy. I didn't know it was slightly sweetened until I got to the bottom of the container. Great drink and/or soup on a chilly night to keep your body warm.  Heads up: The dumplings (which I did not have) on a table nearby were emitting a lot of garlicky smell. It might have been the Chinese chives, but it was overwhelmingly garlicky.  Most Chinese recipes do not use garlic in dumplings, so it was a little unusual.
4 I ordered 2 Bubble Teas--green tea peach and black tea flavors--fried pork buns, pork dumplings, and the veggie sandwich. If you order, get a milk tea; the black tea flavors were a bit too sweet, and if you get the sandwich, get one with meat in it, as the vegetables dont really stand up on their own. The dumplings are delicious though. Recommended spot for a quick bite, but it may be crowded so be prepared to take your food to-go if necessary.
4 2k+ reviews in yelp mean something. So we visited this place late one night after a few drinks, and it was pretty crowded for the time of the day. We ordered vegetarian steamed dumplings. First of all, as a vegetarian, please do not expect the food to be free of meat. The ladies who take order barely speak English so you are not getting any response for whether it has sea food or not. Having said that, these dumplings are worth a try. They are one of the most delicious and stuffed dumplings I have ever had. (Better than the momos we get in India. Wish they had those sauces here). For $4.5 you get 8 dumplings, which is pretty decent.  Do not expect anything fancy. Just a quick stop to grab some Asian flavors.
5 The best dumplings in Chinatown. Very reasonably priced and good selections. Service was attention and fast. Could be a little crowded during lunch or dinner time. So take out would be a better option if you are in a hurry. Every time I go to Chinatown I will get some dumplings and their sesame pancakes are off the hook! Can't wait to go back and grab some of those yummy food!
4 This place was great. Cheap and tiny. They have a good selection of different dumplings (that you can take home frozen I believe). I tried a few things... The fried dumplings were simple and delicious. Exactly what you expect. The noodles with sesame were straight forward and had lots of veggies. I had a pork soup which tasted a lot like a pho. Sesame pancake sandwich with Peking duck was probably favorite. The bread had a lot of chew which I love, the duck was moist and full of flavor. Fried pork buns, again simple, straightforward, delicious. Seating is very limited so show up early or wait for awhile to sit. Order in the back and watch as they prepare/package your order. This is probably more traditional flavors of this cuisine. I am more about those fusion flavors, big and bright flavors. So while it was all delicious (and cheap) I would stop here if nearby but probably won't go out of my way for it.
5 Absolutely love this place! My favorite dish is the Mee Siam, I always get that when I'm there and the Thai Iced tea.
4 It's been years since I last visited this place because I found out there is another branch of Nyonya in Brooklyn which was closer to me.  I was craving for a Malaysian food (Nasi Lemak to be specific) and all I can think of is Nyonya. Honestly, I prefer this branch since the server are nicer and the food prep is pleasing to my eyes and palate. I also like how they presented the images of the dishes on their menu. Food porn! There is another malaysian place near my work but it is nothing compared to Nyonya's.  Soon, my appetite for Malaysian food will surely be back again and I will have the Nasi Lemak of Nyonya as the benchmark. On my future visit(s), I will try out their noodle soup, looks delicious.  Selamat Makan!
4 My friends and I decided to drop by here for a small/quick bite to eat. FOOD:  1.) Roti Canai - The curry was amazing! The crispy style pancake was very thin and light.  Even though it was hard to scoop up the curry at times, the curry made up for the challenge.  2.) Roti Telur - The curry again was amazing. It's probably the same curry they serve for all the roti's. I'm glad we ordered this as well. I couldn't get enough of the curry itself. The pancake itself was light and airy. The egg and onion went well with the pancake and the filling was seasoned well.  3.) Crispy Pork Intestines - Do not let the ingredient of pork intestines scare you. A MUST order. It tastes just like a nice porky sausage. It is not gamy at all and the hoison sauce that is served with it is DELICIOUS!  Not overly salty. It has a nice balance sweet, sour, and salty.  4. ) Hainanese Chicken - The chicken was nice and moist and the soy sauce dressing that the chicken sits on is very tasty. The garlic ginger sauce that came with the chicken goes SO well with the chicken and rice. It looks like the sweet/sour bottle sauce that one can buy at the Asian super market, but don't let the look of the sauce fool you. It tastes fresh. The sauce is a bit heavy handed on the garlic and ginger so prepare yourself.  5.) Chendol - Nice end to a salty tasting of some of their menu items. This dessert is not very sweet, but very refreshing because of the ice. Just enough sweetness to mellow out the savory dishes.   Service was great. The staff were super nice and attentive.   TIP: This is a CASH only place as you would expect of most places in Chinatown.
3 This review is for meal I had a few months ago.  The food is good but I really don't know why the skin on the hainan chicken is soooo yellow. Won't order it next time . The bread with the curry sauce is good but a bit pricey.
4 Came here on a Friday night to find a large crowd waiting out front. However, we only waited about twenty minutes before we were seated (as a party of two it wasn't too hard to do). Something to note, you will have to be assertive with the waitstaff, especially during busy times. I am lucky to have a partner who will do just that. However, the table next to us sat down when our first dishes were coming out and didn't order until we got our check.   We ordered a number of the best dishes including the Hainese chicken. However, my favorite was the pork belly with taro. It was sweet and starchy with fantastically soft pork belly.   The restaurant has an upscale feel with a high-density layout. Be ready for a large crowd but it is certainly worth while. Malaysian food is worth seeking out and is a good alternative to Chinatown and Little Italy nearby. I certainly recommend Nyonya.
5 My belief on judging if an Malaysian restaurant is authentic is solely based on (some of) their signature Hainanese chicken rice and this place is spot on.  The chicken essence flavor rice is never smushy/wet. You can even use your chopsticks to pick up the rice grain by grain. The chicken portion is fair. Key to good flavored chicken is the color on the skin, bright yellow from seasoning. The chicken does not have a greasy or slimey texture. Nyonya has really stepped up the Malaysian cuisine in Chinatown.
4 One of my favorite Asian restaurants in NYC!! Everything is good but would recommend the roti, beef rendang and morning glory vegetable. The curry soup with tofu is also great. We also got the fried prawn dish and it was a tad too sweet for my liking. Will definitely be back to try more things on the menu. Super delicious and authentic Malaysian food!
5 Our favorite dinner spot. Very fast service, reasonable price and delicious! Roti Kanai and Indian mee gorieng are my favorite dish
5 Always make a stop here every time I come to NYC.   order the roti and hainan chicken. It's DELICIOUS
1 Went there to try the food based on yelp reviews. There were some bad reviews but I ignored them. I know there might be days where its busy and service might be slower... So I decided to give them a shot. Mistake number one. Arrived at the restaurant and was sat immediately... not bad. Quick seating for party of two. We sat down and waited for 30 mins till I asked for service. Mind you this restaurant had a few empty tables so they were not busy by any means. I ordered the Hainanese Chicken and my gf ordered the Nasi Lemak along with Malaysian ice tea, along with two appetizers. The two appetizers came, we finished the appetizers and the Malaysian ice tea still didn't come...  I thought maybe they were saving it for the entree? My gf's Nasi Lemak came and I told her to go ahead and start thinking that they probably went to get my dish...20 mins passed by and I'm wondering where are they getting this dish? Were they driving to the chicken farm to get a fresh new chicken for my dinner?! 30 MINS go by and then I wave to the waiter... "sir we ordered at the same time... do you know where my food is?" He goes to check and never come back to tell me anything. 10 mins later I wave to another waiter, who shush me and just told me to wait... At this point I'm pretty hungry and my gf's done with her food. The Malaysian ice tea comes and still no word on my food. This is madness. However good the food is... definitely horrible service. IF the waiters can't do their jobs... get more waiters to help... or get new ones. During that one hour of waiting I was able to observe the waiting staff. They're all over the place. No organization. Everyone is just randomly inviting customers to sit down and going off to do their own thing. There is no follow up with the service. They should just organize it in zones. One waiter handles a certain zone and stick to it so there is no confusion. I must've had 5 different waiters for my table. A different one for drinks, a different one for ordering, a different one for dropping the food off, a different one to check on my order, and a different one for the bill. Basically every time we needed something we had to ask the waiters and they just shushed us and told us to wait. RUDE.   How this place is running is beyond me. There is no organization.  I definitely would not be going back nor will I recommend this place to my friends. I guess I don't get VIP treatment since I'm not a regular.
2 Although their curry is on point, everything slacks from service to the temperature of the food.   When you walk in, the atmosphere is just like all the other Nyonya's - dark and dim. Though it looks small upon entering, but there are space for large groups in the back.   We ordered the "must have" Roti canai, Veggie spring roll, curry chicken with white rice and Hainanese Chicken with flavored rice. One of the entree came out way before everything else including the appetizer...I mean...who does that?? So fine, Hubby had the first bite and the "supposedly" hot dish came out LUKE WARM and with only 4 tiny pieces of chicken on the bone. Shameful. So we waited (3-5 mins), waited (5-10 mins) and WAITED (over 10 mins by now) and trying to hunt down our waitress to ask where's the rest of the food. So finally the Hainanese Chicken came along with the spring roll...and last but not least the Roti. I'm proud that Hubby stated loudly "is that an appetizer?" at the end of our meal. There was no apology of any  sort.   Some may defend the server, others the kitchen (cooks), but regardless, customers should not be left in the cold. There are more than enough staff to accommodate the spacious restaurant that was maybe 65%-75% full with small tables. I'm not being harsh, I was a server once myself too. With that being said, if you're craving Malaysian - go to New Malaysia INSIDE the tunnel between Bowery St and Elizabeth St. Entrance on either street. Service may be slightly better but food is BOMB.
5 Very interesting dishes! Everything on the menu looks fantastic and my friends all had different things that I wanted to try.
5 This is my favorite Asian restaurant in town. 100% authentic Malaysia food. Not street type but delicious dishes. Order Hainan chicken every time. Love the food. Keep the work
5 Another one of my stables since living in New York. I think part of the reason is also because it's so darn close to me so I can walk over and grab something whenever I don't feel like exploring other restaurants. The food is good and solid and the price is decent compare to other Asian Fusion restaurants.   Something to keep in mind, they ONLY accepts cash. There is an ATM machine outside of the restaurant but not sure if it works, but if anything there's also a Chase branch down the block so you won't be shit outta luck!
4 Came here with my boyfriend for a quick and easy solid birthday dinner. We got the Hainese chicken with rice as our go to, solid, delicious plate as well as the hokkien char mee. Both were as expected - flavourful and at a good price point. We also adventured and got the taro and pork belly, which was his favorite. The pork belly was super moist and flavourful, but I actually enjoyed the taro more, which is rare. Overall, a great dish. We had an ABC ice to end for dessert, and it was standard as well. I would give them a 5 star but they're notorious for poor service - our dishes were forgotten on two separate occasions.
2 I ordered Young Tofu for take out yesterday. When I got home I found they gave me Young Tofu noodles instead. The container was filled 50% with noodles. I specifically dId NOT want noodles. Food was good.  I either have to check my order before leaving or eat in from now on.
5 Came here with a party of 10 to celebrate an engagement. We were able to make reservations because it was such a large group and good thing we did! It is a popular restaurant so be prepared to wait 15-20 minutes or so. We ordered about 8 dishes & a few plates of roti canai to share family style. No complaints. The roti was crispy and the curry had really good flavor. The prices are very very reasonable too.   Curry spare ribs & hainanese chicken were all highlights. Nasi lemak is also delicious!   This place has BYOB but it is a $13 corkage fee. Probably goes without saying because of all the other reviews, but this place is CASH ONLY!!
5 I still dream about this place. My god. I had the curry mee with young tofu, and it satisfies that curry itch in all the right places. Slightly sweet, yet salty, spicy but not overpoweringly so, and packed with so much flavor - spices, coconut milk, garlic. Ugh. I am so obsessed with this sauce. We also had one of the rotis (forgot which one) with a curry dipping sauce, and that was also splendid. The service was quick, efficient and no-nonsense, the prices were entirely reasonable for that kind of food. I can't wait till December when I'm back in NY to go eat here again.
3 Food is good. But it's a cash only place. Waiter cleaned the whole table before we even leave. They automatically changed us 18% of tip.
3 This was our second time trying Malaysian food. This place has many options so we are not sure if we ordered the wrong things, but the food didn't stand up to the expectations. We got Poh piah - Steamed malasian spring rolls stuffed with shrimp, eggs, white turnip, dried onion  Nasi lemak - Coconut rice flavored with screwpine leaves with chilli, anchovies, pickles, curried chicken with hard boiled eggs. and Roti telur - Traditional Indian influenced pancake stuffed with eggs and onions. All the things were good but nothing exceptional or worth remembering.
5 The food is really good!!! One of the best restaurants in Chinatown.   I recommend the three dishes I ordered with my friend:   1. Nyonya House Special Squid: it's not very spicy, and the sauce tastes like fried fish pieces.   2. Kang Kung Belacon  3. Seafood Tom Yam Soup: it comes with seafood and noodles.   We also ordered coconut rice, the rice is very soft.   CASH ONLY! They already calculated gratuity for the bill. Take a look at your bill before you pay.
1 The food was alright but the service was extremely bad. We did not know it was a cash only restaurant and the waitress pointed that out to us by rudely just walking by our table and tapping our credit card that was on the bill tray. When we asked for a bowl of rice, she rolled her eyes and just asked in a quick and rude tone, white rice or what?!  At the end of it all the waitress shouted and demanded a tip despite the bad service.  It was our first time and our last time there. Rude service does not make up for the food
5 They are so willing to accommodate no meat/fish dairy/egg - you just have to ASK! All in all everything still tasted great and satisfying even though the meal was vegetarian/vegan.  Some of the standouts were the roti, vegetable clay pot with coconut rice, Chinese watercress and sautéed rice cake! Not too crazy about the vegetarian duck as it was extremely oily. Prices here are great and the meal comes with tea.
4 Malaysian Chinese restaurant in the Manhattan Chinatown area. Had a good crowd waiting during Saturday night, but my friend and I got lucky and only had to wait a few minutes for a small table. Insides were packed... just like what'd you expect from Chinatown. We ordered a few Malaysian specialties. For appetizers, we got the Roti Canai (kind of like a naan, but puffed up and comes with chicken curry for dipping) and the Poh Piah (Malaysian spring roll), and both were pretty good. For main dishes, we had the Asam Laksa (noodle soup) which had a slightly sour flavor that opens up the appetite; the Hokkien Char Mee (stir fried noodles) which was very flavorful, and it tasted quite close to some Chinese chow mein that I had before; and lastly, Nasi Lemak, which should have had a bit more coconut flavor on the rice.   Overall, the food was pretty good. My friend who is Malaysian said it was the best Malaysian food he had in the US. The two appetizers plus three main dishes came to $45 including tips, which was not very expensive at all. Last note is that the place is cash only, so be sure to have a few bills in your wallet before going.
5 Started out with spring rolls.  They were delicious and the sauce was great. I had the Indian Mee Goreng which is Indian style stir-fried egg noodles. I think that was the best noodle dish I ever tasted. I didn't want it to end..lol We also had the Young Chow fried rice some type of beef dish,I don't remember the name but everything was delicious. Odd thing happened thou. They only served my meal and never served my GF's meal and we never got the fried rice. We started sharing mine thinking the other 2 are on the way. They never came,instead they gave us the check which we were charged for the 2 we never received. I didn't take off any stars for this because they were apologetic and friendly. They quickly brought out the other 2 so we ate our meal in 2 parts instead of everyone's meal coming out together.
5 Longing for Hainan food. This place reminded me my fondly memories of visiting Singapore. Food is delicious. Hainan Chicken, Roti, princess tofu, pearl noodle soup. Tiger and Singha beers. Life is good.
5 You want Malaysian cuisine, great service from a knowledgeable staff and ample seating, come here to Nyonya.... I've visited more than enough times to know you'll always head home satisfied with your food. having eaten the food firsthand you'll come to understand why on most evenings there will be crowds waiting to be seated. I'd rather wait for good food then be the only person in a restaurant with bad food.
5 honestly love this place & rave about it all the time because it tastes like home. the chicken rice is my go to--it never disappoints, and the chicken and steamed fish are both incredible for the price. in my opinion, the roti prata was a little tough, but the thin roti canai was perfect and crunchy. the only thing is that the roti prices are pretty steep for such a small portion, but the other dishes are remarkably affordable for the quality and well make up for it. highly recommend the haianese chicken rice combo, hokkien mee, Nyonya mee, steamed market fish, clay pot tofu, and beef rendang (pair it with veggies and rice!) for entrees. best to go with a couple of friends and eat family style. make sure you get the cendol or ice kacang for desert if it's your first time trying Malaysian food/you want to be adventurous, and iced teh tarik to complete the experience.
3 Food is good, service not so much... I have been here a couple of times, I tried stir-fried noodle (chow kueh teow) and the noodle in soup (prawn mee), the firt was ok, the letter was excellent, I recommed that to anybody who likes spicy food! The price is low but.... the service is mediocre, they need to step up their game, each time I was there they forgot my drink, i was done with the food and still nothing... They never returned to make sure that we have everything and that is not good at all.
4 I was looking for some good Malay food in New York and came here with my family. We ordered the more Chinese dishes, which we all found pretty good. The roti canai was crispy and dry; I wish it were softer and thicker.
4 So recently, a Mama friend asked me if I wanted to go on a Malaysian food adventure with our respective families. Well, heck, yeah.  'Cause I'll say 'yes' to pretty much any request that involves the words 'Asian' and 'Food.'  And c'mon, don't get me on technicalities.  'Aysian' is close enough.    Anyway, we were in a big group, which for me, tends to mean I am less focused on the food, but will try to at least remember the standout dishes we ordered.  For better or worse:   A big winner at our table was the tender Beef Rendang, essentially a stew with a lovely, rich curry gravy.  Fried Squid and Fried Tofu Satay were also hits.  Everyone, except yours truly loved the Roti Canai; I thought it was too thin and dry.  Crispy Garlic Chicken was well, crispy, but I think Congee Village delivers better in terms of garlic flavor.  And oh yeah, unless you like fishy tasting shrimp-infused bean sprouts wrapped in a soggy, warm steamed pancake you should probably steer clear of the Poh Piah.  We also got some sort of forgettable Noodle dish and a Sizzling Beef Platter that didn't make much of an impact.  Roti Telur, filled with egg, was just okay too, and kind of bland.  In fact, I think the menu describes at least some of the dishes that we ordered as being 'hot & spicy,' and we encountered none of that. And I wanted to!   Fwiw, the kid ordered a Bubble Tea and when Mama asked if they could make it less sweet, server said it was pre-made.  Needless to say, it was too sweet and on top of that, the boba were mushy.  Bubble Tea connoisseurs steer clear.  On a Saturday night, this place was PACKED. This made the efficient, attentive service we encountered all the more impressive.   Food overall was more like 3 stars, but I loved the energy of this place.  Plus it's strategically located near tons of post-dinner Ice Cream spots, including Ferrara, right next door.  Though we wound up at Taiyaki for Japanese Soft Serve in a warm, waffle-like fish-shaped cone.  We also spotted a minor-ish celebrity.  Yo, Maggie Gyllenhaal, say 'hey' to your bro, Jake from me.    Ultimately, I'd definitely come back, especially for a big group dinner.  I'd just order a bit differently next time.  ps  They take reservations for parties of 9 or more.  double ps  Like everyone says, CASH ONLY.
2 Awful for takeout. Hainanese chicken was cold, dry and had some yellow food coloring on the skin. The stuffed vegetables with fish meat was undercooked in the Young tofu curry soup. Waited for 25 min and paid cash to pick up under cooked food. Very disappointed.
5 I have been going to this place for as long as I can remember! Still go for for family dinners.
5 Not sure this place needs yet another review but...I've already started so let's get this ball rolling.   All of the dishes that people generally recommend are great. The appetizer with the dipping sauce is crispy/chewy and a great way to start off the meal. The hainan chicken and rice is delicious. The rendang beef is so tender and good. The indian mi goreng is flavorful and tasty. The special pork with dried vegetable is so fragrant (and fatty! But in the best way). The fried taro with seafood and veggies is also delish though maybe my least favorite of the set.   All of the above split amongst 4 people came out to 18 dollars per person including tip. What a deal! I'm definitely going back. Going with a group is definitely the way to do it so you can try as many things on their extensive menu as possible!
5 I found this place searching for a good date restaurant near little Italy, and boy did I stumble across a gem! At first I was worried as the restaurant was so crowded the hostess said there was a ten minute wait for two, but to my delight a table opened up in two minutes.   They immediately serve you oolong tea which was light and paired excellently with the meal. The only fault I can find with their menu is that there are too many good options to choose from! From soups to rice to noodles to meat/seafood entrees, there are so many possibilities. I would recommend getting a few dishes and sharing, as I did with my date.  To start we got the chicken dumplings, which were light and packed with flavor. The sauce was the perfect dumpling sauce, just the right blend of salty and sweet. Then we shared the clay pot noodles which was an excellent choice of soup. It comes loaded with ingredients that all blend together into one harmonious dish; thin-sliced chicken, baby shrimp, and squid are simmered in a thick, salty soup accompanied by pieces of baby corn, tender snow peas, mushrooms, and, of course, thin, long noodles.   For my main dish I got the Masak Lemak. It comes with chopped chicken slathered in a sweet, salty chili sauce. It says it is spicy but, per my taste, it's around a 2/5 (I like spice!). I just wish I got a rice dish to go along with it as it didn't come with rice but could've used something to soak up all that flavor.   My date got the Singapore rice noodles which came loaded with shrimp, vegetables, and even some Chinese sausage. The flavors in this one blended together quite nicely and melted the noodles which absorbed all the flavor.   In the end of the day all that food cost us only $40, an awesome value for a unique and delicious cuisine. If you are in Little Italy, tired of Italian and looking for a great place to bring a date or friend, this is the place to go! (Side note, the place is CASH ONLY, so bring cash!)
4 Delicious fried tofu, belacan greens, hainnan chicken, pancakes and iced coffee. The taro nest is good if you like taro. Malay cuisine is a cross between Chinese and southeast Asian flavors, so sweet, spicy, and rich like curries and stews are all in their profile.  They are not known for attention to hospitality but food does arrive quickly, more often than not, and are usually pretty darn good. I've enjoyed the Bklyn location over the city location, but you can't go wrong either way.
5 Nyonya has been around Chinatown for years and it has yet to fail me. It is so good that one time I made the trip to a nearby Chase for like half an hour just to get cash to eat at this place. For the love of god, however, can you at least consider taking credit?  If you know malaysian food well enough you know they count on rice all the time. Any rice dish here will do the trick, but I especially liked the coconut rice - you can choose to have your hainan chicken rice paired with it - and it does wonders. If you ordered curry instead, it is not a must since curry itself is quite heavy, but I still often decide to do so.  They seem to have mastered the art of sauté vegetables since all of them tasted so good, but it could've been the condiments. I'm not sure and I don't really care - it's just that good. Remember to top everything off with a sweet treat which, if I remembered correctly, is called the bobochacha.  With all of that considered, the price still ultimately comes down to a reasonable point. Each of us averaged like $12 and we all had a great time nevertheless.
5 I went here yesterday with my friends. We ordered a half Hainan chicken, stewed beef, and vegetable. The food was good. Next time, I want to try something more Malaysian. As for the atmosphere, the restaurant was large and not noisy. We went there at 11:10, so we did't have to wait. When it was around 12:30 pm, there were more and more people coming in. It probably suggested that it was a popular and good restaurant. The service could be better, but I don't care that much about their service. And it is cash only. Last but not least, it was very affordable. The three dishes were only around 50 dollars.
5 The 5-star rating is based on the price, ambiance, food relationship.  This place is cheap: most dishes are around 8.50$. It's a mix of various Asian geographies: from Singapore Laksha to Malay spicy soup to Korean influenced stuff.  The place is actually modern and feels like a restaurant rather than some of the food sheds in the same price range. So for a sit down it's perfect.  The staff was very kind and the food was excellent for the price albeit the wait was 20 mins.  Their free tea is tasty.   We had Singapore rice vermicelli noodles and a dish with Thai "fat" noodles. Also took a soup. Too much food for 2 people as the soups are huge.  Great place all in all a be we will be back.
4 Nyonya is my first choice for Malaysian food in New York City. Nyonya executes many dishes well, and is great for large groups.  Recommended:  - Beef Rendang - Roti Prata: Excellent. Recommended over the Roti Canai, which in itself is very good. This dish is also easier to share than the latter in a group setting -- just ask a waiter to snip it into smaller portions with scissors. - Fried Pearl Noodles - Roti Canai - Hainanese Chicken - Mango Chicken: Good, but could use more chicken.  - Chinese Watercress. Very good, if a bit salty. I prefer this over the Kang Kung Belacan (water spinach). - Salted Fish with Eggplant: Good, but they had a lettuce wrap at the bottom, even though eggplant is an inexpensive ingredient.  Other: - Shrimp with Lady Fingers: Okra with shrimp and shrimp paste. Mediocre. - Cheng Lai Stingray: Either poorly executed or not fresh. Consider Sanuria on Doyer Street for a better stingray.
4 Nyonya is an established Malaysian restaurant that has been around for years.  When I think of Malaysian, Nyonya is the first to come to mind.    The Roti Canai  is a must.  The homemade roti is thin and crispy and the chicken curry dipping sauce is delicious.  You'll want your own so don't bother thinking if you should share it.  I also recommend the classic stir fried noodle dish, Chow Kueh Teow. It's a flavorful, slightly spicy seafood dish with shrimp and squid. Portions are large even for lunch.    They also have a wide array of fun Asian drinks.  I opted for the frosty coconut milk with red bean.  It was yummy and perfect for a hot summer day.    I was with a table of 5 during a weekday lunch and the service was a bit slow.  I say we waited about 20 long mins for our food to arrive.  So beware if you're in a hurry.  Overall, an inexpensive and fulfilling option for lunch.
4 We went to Nyonya based on a recommendation for their Hainan Chicken.  The Hainan Chicken was not bad, but the rice that came with it was bland.  On the other hand, the Roti Canai was great!  This dish alone is enough to earn a solid 4 stars in my book.
5 It's just awesome, the foods are amazing, also the drinks. Please try their curry vegetables and coconut pudding!
4 ordered Hainan Chicken rice, about 9 bucks.  3 stars to the chicken, tasty, flavoured, the wings was extra soft. Like the ginger sweer n sour dipping sauce, blend very well with the chicken n rice.  1 star to the rice (mixed with chicken oil), yum!  ** if u prefer low sodium, order the chicken with soy sauce on the side. (look at the pic, it's a bit too much for me)
4 Was good but I got the indian bread appetizer and it was cold when it came out. Everything else was good, the hianan chicken is always a staple
5 Super impressed with the service last weekend at one of my go-to restaurants in Chinatown(after-MoCA lecture dinners, inexpensive but impressive tasty & remodeled place for a date, roti canai, beef chow fun, & milk tea cravings).   Went for a late Sunday lunch, was like eating at an auntie's place. Before I finished telling the bleached blonde host "Table for 2," in one sweep he slides the podium over, grabs my suitcase out of my hand and puts it in the corner, slides it back. At the table we're too busy catching up, while 3 different waiters-as they were walking by- stops and ask if we're ready to order.   The beef & coconut rice & seafood tofu curry noodle soup come in what seems under 10minutes. Halfway through dinner, while I'm scooping soup into our bowls, the little ladle falls on the floor. Before friend says "We should ask for a new one." A young kid waiter is trying to reach from it from my friends blind spot, while an auntie type, carrying glasses of water try to reach for it too. The young kid's arm comes from other side and grabs it, the auntie continues along with her waters. Another waiter pops up with a new ladle immediately. Wow!   And our bill came to $11 each Didn't know about Cantonese in Malaysia before discovering this place. It's that southern charm   Oh & highly recommend: Curry Mee with Young Tau Foo(spicy & savory) $8.50, Fried Pearl Noodles $8.50 (think it's GF?), Indian Mee Goreng $8.50 Hainanese Chicken with Rice $7.25
4 Solid Southeast Asian food that always has a wait. So many great dishes available - highly recommend.
3 I found this place through yelp. We went in during their lunch specials. Great pricing. However, the service was disappointing. We didn't get our drinks till after our food arrived. We had to ask for refills. And they never checked on us. It was not a busy time so I'm not sure why we didn't receive good service. The food was OK nothing to rave about. I guess for the price what got what we paid for. FYI, they only take cash.
1 This place is off. First I had to ask 3 different servers 5 times to get a glass of ice water over the span of waiting for our food to come out. We finally got it like a couple minutes before the food. The servers here literally don't know how to do their jobs. It would be one thing if the place was full. But it was basically empty.
5 One of my favorite places to take people. Malaysian isn't always at the top of the list of cuisines to have in New York, but Nyonya consistently delivers a great introduction to flavors that are usually new to my friends (and at one time was new to me too).  My favorite is their homemade Roti. Any of the variations, they're all pretty good.
2 Presentation is fine but the flavor is very blame. I expect rich, bold flavor from Nyonya food but it's just not there. Even the shaved ice is mediocre. Overpriced and overrated. Cash only.
2 I was in Chinatown working and decided to stop by here for some lunch at 1:20pm. Walked in  and I could tell it was semi packed because it's around late lunch time. We were seated very quickly and we placed our order of 2 Rotis and half a Hainanese chicken and the chicken costed $12.95 around 1:25pm. I watched as many other costumers got their Rotis and food, while my friend and I waited for 45 mins for 1 Roti and the 2nd roti came out about 4 mins afterwards. After a few more mins our chicken came out. The service was a little slow today. I was eating the Hainanese chicken and it was very dry & my friend said it had an odd taste to it but I believe it was just the sauce. I was a little disappointed in the chicken today. The roti was pretty good, but the curry sauce that came with it was a little too chunky for me. As another table sat next to my friend and I they received their food much faster than me. Service 4  Food 4  Atmosphere 6
5 I haven't had Malaysian food in years and this transported me right back to Malaysia. The food is delicious, authentic, and fresh. It is a popular place, so I recommend getting there for an earlier dinner to cut the crowds.   LOVE: - quick, attentive service - fresh juices - large portions (definitely go family style!) - very very affordable  Great place for a casual date or group dinner! Not a very fancy place!   If you haven't had Malaysian food before, this is the place to start!
4 When I moved away from NYC for college, this was the place I missed the most. Seriously, it is so hard to find good Malaysian food anywhere.. this place hits the spot. They have a huge variety for their menu, so I enjoy going here when I can't decide what I'm in the mood for. I can pick a soup, noodles, rice, or delicious apps. I've never left disappointed.   I couldn't give them 5 stars because their service is pretty bad. I've eaten here enough to know it wasn't just a bad day, or bad luck. I just can't stop coming here because their food is amazing.   CASH ONLY, so make sure you go to the bank before arriving.
2 I love Malaysian food but ..this is disappointing. I really wish I could bump it up to 3 stars because the server is really great but the food isn't letting me. To give some credit to the server, he was genuinely friendly and attentive. We ordered 5 starters that came in much bigger portions compared to the pictures so he gave us a bigger table. Asked if I wanted water instead of tea, gave us more napkins, saw that all our food didn't come out yet and personally went to fetch it without being asked to. :/   The reason why I think the food isn't so great is because the tofu, fishcakes, and roti canai have a stale taste &texture.
4 Been going here for years... food is excellent and prices are great but portions are kind of small.  Overall one of my favorite asian restaurants in NYC
5 Nearly all of Nyonya's dishes that I've tried are great. My favorites are hainanese chicken with either coconut or chicken rice (great mild flavor for summer), roti canai as an appetizer and house special pork with dried vegetables (flavorful, tender pork belly).   The restaurant gets quite crowded at dinner, but you can order to-go and also reserve a table in advance. Overall, the place is a perfect air-conditioned rest stop at the corner of Chinatown. Lunch specials are only $8 and servings are generous and filling. Cash only!
2 I have been a long and loyal customer of Nyonya, even prior to its moving from across the street. I have to say that the food here is satisfying and have been consistent throughout the years. For that, they have earned themselves a two star review.  The prices here have increased steadily over the years, which I understand due to inflation and such. However, as a customer I feel that I have been ripped off. When my vegetable dish came, it was quickly devoured in mere minutes and it wasn't because it was mouthwatering good. It was because of the portion size. To be paying $12 for a small portion of the Kang kung belacan is quite ridiculous considering I can finish that plus an entree on my own.  In addition to the overpriced dishes, the staff members there not only got my orders wrong once but three times. I ordered the salted fish fried noodle with no beansprouts (because I'm allergic) and waited for a good twenty minutes before getting a seafood fried noodle (without beansprouts). Clearly it wasn't what I wanted since it wasn't what I ordered, so of course I sent it back to the kitchen. Not long after I got my order..the salted fish noodle with loads and loads of beansprouts. I didn't say anything. I should've, but I wasn't going to sit and wait for another dish to come, besides everyone else was more than halfway done with their meal. So I sucked it up and handpicked almost every piece of beansprout there was and continued with my meal.  Towards the end of my meal I ordered a beef ren dang with yellow rice. Got the beef ren dang but no rice. So I informed them. They quickly took care of my order but of course they didn't give me the yellow rice, instead I got the white. So now my sister is disappointed with her food. Now I didn't write this review because of one bad experience, it was time and time again that urged me to write this review. Nyonya, it's time to get it together, but until then I think it's time to seek out my next favorite Malaysian restaurant.  Oh and I had forgotten to mention, in terms of drinks you're probably better off getting it from elsewhere. I was charged $4.50 for a longan ice. Drink was straight from the canned syrup with added water and some ice. Not worth it at all.
4 Their Roti Canai is a must!  Came here with a friend for early dinner on a Wednesday. It wasn't crowded but I passed by here several times and saw how packed it can get during the weekends so plan accordingly. We were seated immediately, given that it was a hump day and not your ideal weather outside.  We got the homemade Roti Canai ($3.95) aka their "Indian pancake." The pancake was crispy on the edges and the portion of the dish was big enough for two to share. The curry dipping sauce had a kick to it but I'm all about that spice so it was A+ in my books.   Another dish we ordered was the Curry Mee with Young Tau Foo ($8.50), which is essentially a bowl of egg noodles with spicy lemongrass coconut curry. Toppings included tofu and vegetables stuffed with minced dish. This also had a kick to it, which I loved. Soup was so flavorful, full of spice and the noodles were chewy indeed.   You can't go to a Malaysian restaurant without ordering Hainanese Chicken (1/4: $8.25 & 1/2: $10.95). I went with the quarter, which was more than enough for one person. Eat it with their chicken broth rice ($1.75) so you can drench it with their "Chef's soy sauce." You can also go with plain rice ($1.50), coconut rice ($1.75) or brown rice ($1.75). But trust me, you'll want the chicken broth one. I'm not a huge rice eater but when it comes with Hainanese chicken, it's a must.  They seem to have a wide selection in their menu going from appetizers, soups, fried noodles, soup noodles, rice dishes, poultry, pork, beef, vegetarian options, casseroles, sizzling platters, seafood, lobsters and dungeon crabs. They also have dessert options and beverages including wine and beers. In addition, lunch special is from Mondays to Fridays (11am-4pm), served with their soup of the day.   It's so spacious inside, layout is somewhat in a "L" shape. I saw some servers cleaning vegetables in the back with some others taking cat naps where it's not really visible from the front of the restaurant. I noticed while walking to their restroom, which is located in the far back, straight down from the entrance.  Overall, they have a wide selection, good service, lots of seating and reasonable prices. Only downside is that it's cash only. Nonetheless, I'll definitely come back again.
5 Perfectly cooked in texture and flavor. Would highly recommend for those who love shrimp taste and curries.
5 Try their amazing Bak Kut Teh and the fish noodles soup..... I used to go to Wok Wok so much and it's time for a change..... Can't wait to try the other dishes here!!!!!!
5 Great food everyone loved it very fresh love Malaysian food.
1 I sat down and left immediately when I saw a half-eaten dead fish in the tank. It made me shudder. I would never eat here, ever.
2 It would not call it asian fusion but rather a restaurant that can't decide on which cuisine to serve and ultimately settles on offering several cuisines but excels at none.
4 Cery good and amazing variety of Malay, Chinese foods, drink.  Well priced. CLEAN and will be back!
1 The thing with success is it can be very bad for a business as it can be good, depends on how they continue to service their customers (especially one that has been coming since the beginning). I placed my order for pickup over the phone and upon arrival was asked to wait as my order was not ready (which is fine, I've waited many times before and not for long). They are usually speedy at least the kitchen is. In this instance, and I believe this lady is an owner, or partner, or manager as I've seen her throughout the years was too busy counting the register irregardless that my order was packed and places on the checkout counter. I sat there wondering what was up with the kitchen but upon asking I realized that she just did not care that their were orders ready and customers sitting waiting for their orders. This is NYC, don't waste a New Yorkers time. Treat your customers well or best of luck as this city has much to offer and many a willing to greet and service customers properly and readily.
4 Been to nyonya for more than 15 yrs from their old location across the street to this new location.  Their staffs have come and go, their food used to be top notch authentic for a Malaysian like me. This is the place I will go for my home food fix.  I don't know what happened to them in the recent year, their staff are not as friendly and their food's standard has dropped. Maybe they have a new chef ‍ but it's hard to judge as the manager/owner is still there. I will still go back to get my fix but I have to admit that it is not as great as it used to be. Those were the glory days I guess. Warning for newbie, there are some items on the menu can be challenging for newbie i.e. Assam Laksa, squid tentacles , just ask the manager to recommend if it's ur first time.  The classic items I usually order are - Char Kway Teow, Roti Canai, Seafood Horfun, Hainanese Chicken Rice, Golden Crispy Squid, Curry Laksa Noodle, KangKung Belacan and Crispy Fried Fish with various sauces.
1 Wasn't really expecting much from an asian fusion spot but this is by far one of the worst asian fusion spots. Lots of seating and surprisingly clean but the food is so bad. Rice rolls were dry. Casseroles were off flavored. Tried half a dozen dishes total and I am confident saying: you are way better off going to almost any other Chinatown spot.
4 Delicious and good priced duck over rice dish. My favorite. I would visit or order from here again.
4 I'm surprised to say it was actually a nice experience here for I didn't expect much.  The food was good and came in generous portions.  The service was adequate granted it place wasn't wall-to-wall packed.  I was also surprised to see the prices weren't absolutely ridiculous and there are plenty of reasonably priced options.  There wasn't much about the food that was considerably memorable but I did leave with the concrete impression that it was good enough and didn't break the bank.   FYI, cash only.  I don't have any recommendations this time around but maybe I'll explore the menu a little bit next time and find something remarkable.
4 Great food and decent prices. Be warned, CASH ONLY!   My friends and I shared 3 plates-we all left happy and full. I wish I remembered what we ordered. I think their Malaysian spare ribs, garlic chicken, and one of their recommended noodle dishes.   It was all pretty good, although I could skip on the Malaysian fried spare ribs. I plan to return and try more of their menu when I'm not restricted by friends' food allergies.
4 Everything good except Nasi Lemak. Didnt taste like Nasi Lemak at all. Otherwise service portion sizes and pricing are all
4 Heard great things about this place and had to give it a try! It's a dimly lit restaurant with a very modern feel. I came on a Saturday afternoon and there was no wait, there is plenty of seating in the back. Even though I heard it was really good, I walked in not expecting anything special, but in the end the dishes blew me away.   For a party of four we ordered Roti canai, Hainan chicken (1/2 chicken), fried squid, vegetable curry casserole, stir fry noodles (don't remember which one), and one bowl of white rice.   The best thing that we ordered was probably the casserole, followed by the fried squid. The stir fry noodles were pretty decent, as was the Hainan chicken (it was nothing special in my experience). For some reason the Roti we received wasn't hot and was pretty hard when we got it, maybe because they had it made a while before.   TIP: if you get anything with curry, make sure you eat rice with it. The curry casserole tastes amazing with white rice.   The portions are decently sized, larger than I expected and in the end we walked out very full for $17 a person (tip included).   Overall, I really do like this place, if I come back though I would switch out some of the orders that I had.
4 i just love the food here! so flavorful but sometimes does get a bit too salty though... ordered by phone and they made it wrong. Ordered beef rendang but they gave me chicken, still delicious but man i ordered beef... anyways i can't hate this place.
1 The food was great, BUT I can't say the same about the service.   After paying for my meal at the front counter, I was stopped by my waitress who demanded me for tip. I  literally took two steps and was headed back to my table to leave tip there before she stopped me. So I handed her the tip (despite her attitude) and she complained about it not being enough... She actually stood in front of me, blocking my way until I gave her exactly one more dollar.  Last time I checked, tip is based on service and considering the service I got, I shouldn't have even tipped at all.
4 Roti canai  Asam laksa  Ginger duck egg noodles  Coconut curry chicken noodle dish  Satay, both chicken and beef,   My sister and I stopped in after our haircut. We've been coming to this place for years. Love their roti canai, light papery dough that you dip into their bomb curry sauce. The ginger duck noodle dish was a bit on the saltier end. Tried my sister's coconut curry chicken noodle dish and that was straight . Prices are so cheap for the portion and quality. Def recommend this place if you're craving endless options of Chinese/Malay food!
3 I came here on the recommendation of one of my friends who really wanted to try this place out.   We came to the restaurant before the dinner rush started and were seated immediately. They have a pretty expansive menu of different options. As a forewarning there is limited vegetarian options found at this place.  I started off with the roti pani and it was alright. The curry was very well seasoned and wasn't too spicy which I liked. The roti was just not up to par. I thought that it was too crispy all around and didn't have enough dough towards the center. Every time I would try to dip my roti in the curry it would just end up breaking.   I also got the fish noodle soup and it was alright too. I thought the noodles were a little bit too over cooked and the broth was too overly salted. The waiter did give me a forewarning that it would have a very fishy taste to it. I just thought they could have seasoned it with something else as well.   All in all, it was an okay experience. I wasn't blown away by the food but the waiter was very nice and accommodating.
5 CASH ONLY! Every dish is so delicious! We were told to wait for 10 min at 7pm Friday. There were still so many people waiting when we walked out at 9pm. Homemade Roti Canai (Indian Pancake) and chicken were must for most tables. For Ginger Duck Noodles, the duck was rich in flavor. My favorite was Tomyam Fish Head, so yummy! We ordered 6-7 dishes in total and for about $100! Amazing! Food came fast and service was efficient.
5 Authentic southeast Asian flavors with reasonable price. Every dish we ordered was really delicious.
1 Really disappointed with the service at this place. Was greeted in by a guy who was sweeping the floors and he ended up taking his broom with him to seat us at our table. Then the waitress was staring at us impatiently until we were ready to order. From there, it was a disaster. They gave our first dish out of four and never came back. After waiting for 20 minutes, we asked and they still didn't know when the rest were coming. It took another 20 minutes for the 2 dishes to come. Our appetizer came last when we were finished with our meals and they didn't even give the water and tea that I had asked for until the bill came.
4 Nice Asian restaurant, with a lot of options and big plates. Service was efficient, and the space looks nicer than other Asian restaurants.  Cash only!
4 Great food for cheap! Not oily and very good portion sizes. I just wish that the waiters would be a little bit more attentive.
5 great asian food! very authentic and tasty. love love the Hainanese chicken and watercress!
4 OMG! Who knew you could get such great food at such a great price in NYC. Just the thought is driving me wild. I went here with my partner and and we had such a great time. The staff made us feel taken care of and set the mood for a wonderful day. If you like spicy food or just want to spice things up in your life this is a great spot.
2 Omg, there's probably tremendous changes with Nyonya.   I'm a regular here. I've here regularly for over three years. But my recent visit made me reconsider whether I should dine here again.  Start of with their food. I ordered 5 dishes 1 drink and 1 dessert, and only three dishes were ok. Here're what I ordered: roti canai, fried buns, spicy squid tentacles, kang kung, duck with ginger and scallion, Malaysian tea and coconut pudding. Seriously, the food were just ok, the food didn't not lived up to its standard.   Roti canai was tasteless, the curry  didn't have any taste. It didn't taste like roti canai that I used to order from here.  Kang kung was bland and too oily. And the vegetables was overcooked.   Price-wise, always reasonable.   Service-wise, took 30 mins for a dish. This place used to be super fast but not anymore. Not only the service is slow, the waiter was inattentive as well.   Will I continue to be a regular here? No  Will I recommend this restaurant to my friends? No  Am I going to Nyonya in the future? No  If any person-in-charge of Nyonya ever read my review, please consider and improve the food and service.
5 Nyona sure knows how to satisfy my Malaysian cravings! Unfortunately, LA doesn't really have Malaysian food... I used to come here with my fam as a youngin' (reminiscing). Anywho, my bf and I were in town and we met with a few of my gf's. I was the only experienced Nyona eater and my Caucasian peeps LOVED it. We got to the restaurant around 6:30 PM on a Friday and got a number. We waited for about half an hour to be called in for our table. Note, try to get here early or prepare to be part of the massive groups waiting outside.  Atmosphere: B   loud, bustling, busy, packed, aromatic, nicer décor  Food: A+  We ordered Roti Canai,Vegetable Spring Rolls, Fried Dumplings, Hainanese Chicken, Young Chow Fried Rice, Beef Chow Fun, and Shrimp String Beans Malaysian Style. I always order the Roti Canai, it's my favorite type of roti and together with curry is PERFECTION.The vegetable spring rolls and friend dumplings were yummy and basic. The Hainanese Chicken was delicious. I always love their sauces together; a little sweet, sour, and tangy. The young chow was and beef chow fun were delicious but you could get this at other Chinese restaurants, btw. The waiter warned us of the "Shrimpy flavor" of the string beans but we enjoyed the dish anyway! Basically, there was barely any leftovers because everyone loved the food.  Service: A+  They gave us their recommendations, opinions, and they were not mad or showing us any frustrations when my bf knocked over his beer twice... The food came in a timely matter, with the appetizers first instead of all at once. The waiters could crack a smile but very rarely do you see a smiling Asian restaurant worker.   I would be back in a heartbeat because the food is lip smacking good. YUM YUM.
4 Food was great, this spot is so much better than the brooklyn location. I ordered the roti canai, seafood egg noodle and prawn mee. Only thing i wish they put a bit more seafood for both dishes, even some cheap but delicious fish cakes would be amazing.
2 The selection of Malaysian food in chinatown is pretty limited. This is one of the two places left now and location wise, this place gets plenty of foot traffic. The food is decent, but I think that both the food and service had kind of went downhill since the competition decreased. I ordered my usual hainanese chicken rice and the rice tasted a little sour as if it had just passed its prime. The server was nice and offered to exchange it for another bowl, but even with the new bowl of rice, it still didn't taste right. We also ordered a stir-fry noodle dish with sauce, which we could barely stomach due to the amount of salt used to flavor the dish (imagine noodles drenched in salt water thickened with cornstarch).  Bottom line, I was disappointed since this is one of my usual go to places to eat in the area. I guess I'll have to wait till I go to Asia for some good Malaysian food!
5 My favorite Malaysian restaurant in NYC. Cannot get enough of their food. I usually go there at least once a week.
5 Nyonya was incredible! I had no idea this place even existed but I loved it!  The food was on another level. I had their famous chicken, pad thai, and their spring rolls appetizer. The flavors were delicious. It was some of the best Malaysian food that I have had. The service was solid and the restaurant was clean.  Can't wait to go back and I would definitely recommend Nyonya! Five stars!
5 Great food  Great experiences and great customer service Andy was great and super good prices
4 The food is tasty here, the portion sizes are huge, and it's pretty darn cheap for what you get. Love the chicken broth rice, and the veggie clay pot curry. Classics like hainanese chicken and roti canai are well done, and I've also enjoyed whatever random dishes I've tried. I hated the ABC dessert but would not deduct a star. Somehow I always end up bringing people here and they are usually happy.  Service is on par with typical Asian restaurants - efficient and brusque. It's a cash only place so stop by an ATM first! But you don't need too much... just went with a party of 11 and it was about $200 with everyone very satisfied.
5 If you want Malaysian, this is definitely the spot. My ma and pa used to take me here when I was a yungin' and being the first Malaysian restaurant I've ever been to, they've set the bar really high for other places.  This place is located on the border of Chinatown and Little Italy, and with so many other places to eat, Nyona can be pretty easy to miss. However if you stop by, you'll be glad you did. The place looks small from the outside, but when you walk in, you'll be surprised by how big it really is. The seats are pretty close together so it can feel crowded if they get busy. There's seating available for small and large group. When I went, we got a nice seat with a window view. You can come here for a casual meal, but this is one of those nicer restaurants. The lighting is dim, but the place looks clean as far as I can tell.   The food is amazing. The menu is huge and can be a little overwhelming if this is your first time and have never has Malaysian. However, I've had a lot of their items and can tell you you'll be safe with almost anything you pick. The ingredients are fresh has the perfect amount of seasoning. The owner of the place is actually Malaysian and I've heard that some of their ingredients are shipped from Malaysia (don't know if this is true but I believe it). Most items are $10+ so it's no cheap eat, but definitely very fair for the quality you are getting.  The service was pretty average. Not bad, but nothing special to say about it.  Conclusion: if you've never been here, you're missing out.
4 This place as a very nice atmosphere and the food was absolutely delicious although some of the appetizers were a bit expensive for there portion size. The service was great and the wait wasn't very long either. Overall it was a very delicious meal!
2 Came here for a quick lunch, we ordered from the lunch special menu. it was pretty disappointing. I ordered the taro with sliced pork belly over rice, my mother ordered the spareribs over rice. Spareribs were so tough to eat.   Service was excellent tho, they found a nice seat for us so we could put my son (infant) next to us. They also have an infant changing table, which is GREAT! So i definitely applaud them for that!
4 This place might be my favorite Malaysian restaurant, if only out of nostalgia (I've been coming here before Chinatown was ~hip~). With the area constantly gentrifying and new businesses popping up like weeds, it's nice to see that Nyonya has remained after all this time - and for good reason.  After a poor experience at another restaurant where miscommunications with the hostess led to a 2 hour wait, I was really happy when the Nyonya hostess came outside to call numbers for those of us standing out front because the waiting area was full. It wasn't a huge deal but it still meant a lot. My friend and I waited about 20 minutes, which wasn't too bad for a busy Saturday night. It was a bit hard to get ahold of a server at times, and we had to ask more than once for water, but other than that it was fine. I wish I remembered the name of our server because he was so kind and cheerful.  Roti canai, chow kueh teow, and pineapple fried rice are my go-to dishes. I'm pretty basic. The entree portions are a good size - more than I can finish in one sitting. Affordable and so so delicious. Don't ever change, Nyonya.
2 Two stars for the good food but they really need to improve on the sanitation. Went in someday this week and ordered a Nasik Lamar for take out. When I ate the food, there was a piece of hair stuck in the rice, pretty shocking because their grade is A I believe. I called them immediately to tell them about it and I had to repeat myself three times because telling the guy "There was a piece of hair stuck in my rice" was confusing the first two times. After he finally heard it, he rushed the conversation telling me to bring it back and I continued to tell him I would go right when the rain stops pouring. He kept saying okay okay okay and rushed me to end the conversation. When I went back, I told him that I called to tell him there was hair in my rice. He opened the bag but not the box to check and was about to bring it to the back to have them remake one but I figured I'd be better off getting a refund. I asked for a refund instead and he seemed unwillingly to give me the refund, not to mention that he didn't even apologize for this. Never coming back again, I can get Malaysian food somewhere else.
4 Great place for south Asian food! Spacious inside but still full at weekend dinner time, might need to wait for a while. Their Indian pancake and coconut rice are classic! Everything else we ordered are great too! Will definitely come back when I think about Malaysian food~
4 Decent Malaysian food, good portions, bad service. Get the prawn mee here! Also cash only.
5 This place was absolutely delicious and the service was great as well. Read all the reviews and decided to try it out and it did not disappoint. Tried so many items and all of them were great. See my picture with our items.
2 I've been going to their Brooklyn 8th avenue location and Manhattan location for years. I was out of state for about a year and came back to Nyonya a couple of days ago and am sad to say their quality in food has decreased substantially. We ordered the Roti Prata, the curry was so watered down that it was basically soup. I ordered the chicken curry in the rice dish category while my friend ordered the seafood with crispy noodles. Everyone else that were seated and ordered after us received their food before us. I understand that some food takes a bit more time, but when I received my chicken curry, I asked a waiter where my rice was, and he said someone will bring it to you. We waited for about 15 minutes before I went up to another waiter who told me the dish didn't come with rice. I then spoke to the lady mending the cash register who said someone would take care of me shortly, another 10 minutes passed before the lady herself took my chicken curry away and told me they had the order wrong. A few minutes later she came back with the same chicken curry, except with a few pieces of chicken short with rice. What in the world were they going to do with the few pieces of chicken? Serve it to another customer? I could've touched it, why take it back? Extremely disappointed.
4 Came here with a friend on a pretty quiet weekday evening, was seated immediately. The food was pretty good (though in my opinion, not as good as Laut, which is the other Malaysian food spot I love). We ordered the roti canai to start -- it was okay, not as fluffy/creamy as stuff I'd had before. The beef rendang was great, very tender and well-flavoured. The chow fun noodles were only okay. Portion sizes are extremely large, and between the two of us we couldn't finish everything, so be aware of that. Service was a little bit slow, but once we beckoned someone over they were very prompt. Overall, would definitely go again, but probably not my first choice for Malaysian food cravings.
4 I've been coming here for years now. I really like some of their dishes, and some are ehh, not so great as in there's nothing special about it. My boyfriend and I came here for late Saturday lunch, we ordered the usual Hainanese chicken and kang kung belancan. Since he wanted to try something new, we also got the Thai bean curd, which is just regular tofu.   Hainanese chicken: very tender and flavorful, we usually get 1/4 or 1/2 of the chicken. It's in a sweet soy sauce base, and there's a plate of hot sauce that's a bit sweet on the side. The combination is very good, a classic transitional Malaysian dish.   Kang Kung Belancan: thin green leafy vegetable with shrimp paste mixed in, spicy and tangy, very delicious!   Thai bean curd: ehh, nothing special about it. Just bean curd with some salty sauce, I'll pass.   Overall, we will try something new next time but will keep getting the kang kung belancan!
5 I love that this place closes late and has such a big menu at all price points. Service is always decent, the place is clean, food is like the photos
3 It's cute and cheap. The food is nice but nothing blew our minds. I like that there is a pot of hot tea on every table. Skip the dessert. We ordered mango pudding (its not puddling at all, it's disgusting artificiality flavored jello), and two warm specialties: with coconut rice and the red bean, both were mediocre at best. We left it all and ate the chocolate my friend had in her bag instead.
5 Literally the best Malaysian food I've ever had. I've been coming to Nyonya whenever I need my fix of fried noodles and Roti Canai.  I've tried a couple of other dishes and none of them have disappointed me. I've been to the Nyonya in Brooklyn as well and it was just as amazing.   Really good food for the price! Come to Nyonya because your stomach and your wallet would be full!
3 Just okay.  The waitstaff seemed overworked and inattentive, but the food came out fairly quickly.  This is what we sampled on our lunchtime visit recently:  Roti canai appetizer - at first we didn't order this, but after seeing it being delivered to several other tables I wanted to give it a try.  Roti was good and the curry dipping sauce was very nice. Hokkien char mee noodles - rather disappointing.  The noodles were overcooked and overworked to the point that they were mostly 2-inch long remnants, which made it difficult to eat with chopsticks.  It was made with way too much soy sauce and cornstarch (I assume that's what they used to thicken the sauce). Hainanese chicken - served at room temperature, which was expected.  Nothing special about this one, and I find it curious that it's so popular.  It's basically just a steamed chicken, but the flavor wasn't particularly distinctive. Garlic chicken - much, much better than the Hainanese chicken, as judged by the group of us at the table.  Probably could have used even more garlic, but the flavor and texture was very good. Sizzling tofu - definitely the best of the dishes that we ordered.  Large, soft chunks of tofu cooked with vegetables and a medium soy-based sauce.  Was labeled as a spicy dish but it was overall just a mild heat to it.  This is cash-only establishment, which is made very clear on the door and the front desk upon entering.  Overall this was a mixed experience for us and I'm not sure we'll return on our next trip to New York.
4 Currently our "go to" for Malaysian food in Manhattan Chinatown.   This place is cash only.  Street parking Serves liqour  Can accommodate large groups  Roti- nice and thin /crispy. The curry dip is a little inconsistent, some days are better than others.   Hainese chicken- is good, smooth texture and the portions are great  Beef rangdang- large peices of meat. Tender and a little spicy  Overall the food is good. But this place gets packed. When its peak hour, food comes out in weird orders. I've gotten my chicken before my roti . But they dont try to rush you, which i like. Most of the staff understands basic english so you dont have to worry about ordering.
3 Started off strong.  Good food, good prices.  But lately it seems pretty mediocre.  The more interesting items only get served on certain days, they cost more and the supply runs out.
5 Nyona in a word - authentic. You don't have to be Malaysian to know this. You simply need to see who's eating there. Plenty of Malaysians no doubt, and some savvy New Yorkers (and tourists I suspect). So many options and so neatly organized in a visually appealing menu. And that's not the only visually appealing thing. As the dishes come out to patrons I found myself following each one with my eyes. I finally settled on a rich curry soup of fish stock and noodles. OMG delicious. And the prices are incredibly affordable, around $8.50 for that huge portion that I ended up having enough left over to have for dinner as well. The service is extremely amiable as you are served by a team of waiters and waitresses, as was explained to me by one of the super pleasant servers. This makes for incredible efficiency too. By all means, go and if you're lucky enough to get a seat, you'll surely enjoy some yummy eats as well.
4 Absolutely love this place. I had never had Malaysian food before and it's definitely a yummy place to start. Service is great and food comes out fast.
3 I've been on this unexplained hunt for Hainan chicken for the longest time... and I thought the godmother of Malaysian/Chinese food in NYC would solve my craving. But I was wrong. Despite several warnings that Nyonya was just average by the local standard, I needed to go and see for myself.   Lunch wasn't crowded so I took my time to browse all 20 pages of the menu... Okay, still set on the Hainan chicken (although I was pretty swayed by the tables around me). Also chose the specialty appetizer (Nyonya Rojak) that mandated patrons check with the waiters. Alrighty then.   Nyonya Rojak - "Strong fishy taste. Nyonya famous fruit salad served with squid, shrimp paste sauce, sesame seed and peanuts. Hot and spicy." I regret ordering this to this day... This was such an interesting combination that I wanted to claim I loved it. That I loved the fusion, the flavors, the adventurous of it all - but I can't. I truly hated it. It's an acquired taste that I didn't have, and probably will never acquire. Be adventurous and try it if you must - I warned you about this mess.  Hainan Chicken - "Steamed chicken with bone (room temperature) and chef's soy sauce." Average. Actually at this point, I don't know if I've been building up the hype in my mind or what. But this was average, chicken wasn't exactly falling off from the bones and the rice is less flavorful than what I'm used to.  I don't know, man, but my expectations were way up there. I'd come back to try other stuff - especially since I'm still kicking myself for not ordering all the deliciousness that I saw on the other tables...
5 I always get the prawn mee. If you're a fan just get it and you'll be slurping it to the last spoon!
3 It's a restaurant that has locations in other places, and this one feels much more touristy than the one in Brooklyn. The food is alright, a bit salty, and it's very crowded. The menu has images, so it's good if you don't know what you're ordering. As one would expect, it's loud and crowded. When it's busy, the waiters seem eager for you to finish eating. It's a decent place to eat with friends.
5 I always get chicken curry with rice, its very good and hits the spot. Only downside about this place is the cash only policy.
5 Cash only!  Huge menu selection. All types of food. Menu goes in depth with numerous categories from vegetarian, to poultry, to lobster. Extensive menu. May be even too much.  Place is booming with customers. Good, open space. Plenty of room for several parties. Great spot to hold lots of people. Lighting is a little too dim for my liking, but I guess that makes the atmosphere more authentic.  Nice choice for dinner. Excellent for Chinese cuisine. Generous portions. #1 and #2 were great tasting dishes from the fried noodles section. Phenomenal choices for dinner. Great flavor, with reasonable portions. Food came out ready quite faster than expected. Astonished me with joy. Nice staff. All ready to help and assist in any way possible.  Despite cash only, items on menu are reasonably priced. If anything, this restaurant is affordable.  Looks can be deceiving! Cash only, yet fairly affordable. Guess there is more than meets the eye!
4 Love love love love their garlic chicken! But last time I went it was sold out one tear.  I definitely recommend the garlic chicken and there is another birds nest it's deep fried taro inside is chicken and veggies it's also super amazing dish!  If you guys are a fan of peanut butter I recommend the peanut pancake
5 Really good service. decent prices-cash only. Curry veggie soup was so good!!!! Great ambience. Highly recommend.
3 Good spot to go to if you're in the area and want to satisfy your Malaysian food cravings. I wouldn't say this is the best Malaysian spot I've been to though. The staff here is always great. Super friendly and attentive.  As for the food I ordered the roti canai, hainanese chicken with chicken rice, and hokkien meen, all to share! The roti canai was good, but when it arrived it was cold (both the curry sauce and bread) which obviously makes it not as good. The chicken was yummy, but the rice was a little bland and lacking the chicken taste. Lastly the hokkien meen which is stir fried egg noodles with shrimp, chicken, and squid (?), that was actually the best one out of the 3! The portion was also very good.  Overall, I recommend this spot for a quick fix and if you're feeling Malaysian. I actually never come here as this isn't one of my go-to spots in Chinatown, but it does the job when you need it to.
4 Long wait, but you knew that. Food is great but not sure I'd wait an hour for it a second time. My BF and I split a Malaysian iced tea, roti canai, mango chicken and pineapple fried rice. The tea was good, if a little sweet for me. I think I prefer Thai iced tea. Roti and pineapple rice were awesome - definitely the standouts. The mango chicken had a sweet goopy sauce on it that I didn't care for, but it was decent. Service was spotty.
3 Been coming to Dai Wong since I was a child. I've introduced many friends to stop off at this joint being that I've always enjoyed their Won Ton Mein with a side of Cha Siu. But as of late, it seems the noodles broth is lacking something. I was very disappointed as the noodles was bland with the correlation of the broth. Perhaps, the place has changed hands over the years or what. But I'm staying away from Big Wong.
4 Dai Wong as what it's known for in Chinese was one of my childhood staples, although it seems to be more tourist dominated now as most tourists dine-in while the locals mostly order take-out.  Regardless, to this day, it's still my favorite place to get cha siew from - it's a shame that I don't live near Chinatown! This restaurant serves traditional comfort Chinese food at ridiculously cheap prices. You can feed 2 people for under $25! My girlfriend wasn't a fan of the beef ho fun (noodles) that she ordered.   I would stick with the cha siew or the rice dishes (beef with peas is another one of my favorites) instead.
4 I like to come here for a good cheap eat. I get the wonton roast pork ho fun, delicious!  The roast pork has plenty of flavor.  They have the best wontons in Chinatown.
5 The prototypical cantonese congee, noodle, and rice place - almost exactly like great ny noodle on bayard, but bigger, open for fewer hours, and food quality/selection is larger and better.  They're always busy, so go in knowing what you want, don't try to get recommendations from waiters.  Like my other posts about these type of restuarants, if you're in a rush, get something that's chopped/prepped upfront (chicken, bbq pork, duck hanging upfront) with noodles, congee, wontons.  Anything that requires rice or cooking will come from the kitchen in the back, and take a few minutes to cook.  Everything is good, but my staples are bbq pork as a side, duck thick noodles in soup, side of wontons, beef tripe, thousand year old and lean meat congee, fish filet and lettuce congee - all upfront.  Maybe a side of fried dough strips, sweet dough, or dough wrapped in rice noodle.  From the back, staples are panfried beef flat noodles, malay/sing chow maifun, and yeung chow fried rice.
5 Albeit the funny name, the Cantonese style restaurant is a gem located in the bustles of Canal Street. Came here with a friend and got the $28 dollar lobster ginger dish which came with 2 huge lobsters that were amazing. We also ordered a vegetable dish in the side. The service was good, the food came out sketchily fast but was fresh nonetheless, and overall, the experience of authentic Chinese for a good price reminded me of the motherland. If your looking for a place to stop by in Chinatown, definitely give this place a shot!
5 So good - the Chinese BBQ was spot on. Traveled waaaaays to get some good Chinese BBQ. No, they don't have pork belly - but they do have soy sauce chicken, duck and the other pork. I got the duck and pork noodle soup - dad got the duck pork noodle soup too (I think) and mom got the soy sauce chicken and pork lo mein. Super quick preparation. Will be back for more Chinese BBQ when the time comes.
4 I paid $22 for a whole duck here and I ain't even mad.  I haven't been to many Chinatown eateries but this was one of our stops during the food tour we planned over the wknd. I could not stop staring at the roasted ducks and racks of pork hanging on the display. Get into my fucking mouth.   My Chinese friend ordered for me so I just stood there with a smile on my face and whipped out the wallet like a sugar daddy. CASH ONLY! Apparently this is a given in Chinatown; sorry for being so newb.  Duck was salty, fatty, and hit the spot like no other. I stashed two containers of this in my LV and walked around LES smellin like a realllll treat... Risk it for the biscuit!
5 ICONIC TRADITIONAL CHINESE FOOD.  I love this place so much. The waitstaff is friendly and customer service is above average. My fave is the submarine congee witha fried cruller andna side order of shrimp rice noodles or dried shrimp rice noodles.   Places like this are near and dear to my heart. Its soul food for a first gen AA like myself.
4 If Peking Duck is your thing, then you have arrived, young foodie. The line for this crispy delicacy is pretty intense, and you will certainly have to jockey for position to place your order, but it will be worth it.   On this particular visit, I stepped up for some egg rolls and dumplings. Now, I realize customers rave about the duck, but I was a little disappointed with my egg rolls. My egg rolls were a bit bland and lifeless.  My dumplings were better, but I still think The Excellent Dumpling House down the street does a better job.   However, this place is still very authentic, and it should make the most ardent foodie happy. Next time, I think i will try an order of congee which looked pretty good.
2 I came in here dreaming of great vegetarian food, with vegetables. Now my tummy is filled with tons of sweetened starches with no nutritional value whatsoever. I'm utterly disappointed. Please note I do not like any types of mock-meats and have not tried anything of that sort. People seem to rave about those fake meat dishes- so if you like them, this might be your place.
4 Great for a quick fix of Chinese food craving! I've been here countless times and a review is probably due.  Go for the standard, low priced Chinese dishes like the wanton soup, congee. Good consistency on the congee, nice and thick, not too runny. Seafood soup is good as well.  The more expensive dishes like the lobster were definitely not my favorite. Very average at best. My friends and I agreed that the ingredients were not the freshest.  In all, not a bad place! More of a 3.5.
5 Fast real Chinese food. If you're expecting Cheescake Factory service and ambience don't come here.  If you like side street food truck goodness then get the roast pork and chicken with rice. Rice confer with your choice of meats or wonton soup noodles with fried breadstick! To the people who came with 40 thinking reservations would do it, you expected the wrong type of place.  Gruff but fast and good!
5 I love the congee, the cold white rice, and the hot white rice dishes. My bill comes out to somewhere between $5.99 and $8.00.  Fast service.  j usually tip $2
4 My favorite place for over a decade. Simple Cantonese food at great prices.  The roast pork and ribs are delicious.  Even their pork/shrimp dumplings are the best I've ever had.    A great place to take out of towners when you hit Chinatown for a family style dinner. The bbq duck and pork hanging in the window always seems to wow them.   Cash only. It would be 5 stars except for the bathroom set-up.  I never leave here without out an extra lb of roast pork for home!
4 Decent place for simple and good Cantonese food. Their service is scarily quick but if you look past what that could imply in the kitchen, it's fantastic. We got the double lobster, seafood soup and Chinese broccoli which was a good amount of food for two people.
4 Big Wong is great for quick, casual, Cantonese, comfort-food dinner.  You can get all your basics like duck with rice, congee, fried noodles, bbq pork with rice, beef chow fun and seafood fried noodles.  For a super low price. Dinner for two people was around $20!  K and I were under the weather, I was coughing up a storm and super congested. One of the Chinese remedies for a cold is big bowl of congee.   Big Wong's pork congee is huge bowl of salted pork chunks, scallions, strips of springy squid and toasted peanuts. It was perfect remedy.  I felt my sinuses clear after I finished.  And the bbq pork is juicy, half fatty and delicious.  (But not recommended for colds).   And their Chinese vegetables were cooked just right. Clean, no sand, and dollop of oyster sauce on top.   Thanks Big Wong for your attentive service, low low prices and helping me recover from my cold!
4 Old time go to place for wonton noodle soup and simple dinners.  We came here on Friday while both me and my wife were "under the weather."  We thought Congee Soup would hit the spot.  And we asked the waiter what else he recommends.  He said the cha siu and the duck are the usual favorites there, so we ordered a side of cha siu (roast port) and some veggies.  The bowl of congee is definitely a "man size" portion, and it taste exactly like it should when we were kids living in Hong Kong.  That's an accomplishment.  Love this place, simple, no frills, but that's exactly what the Doctor ordered today.
5 Yummm yummmm I think this is the best place for congee. The bowl of congee is not shy of the amount of preserved egg and pork. Every bite is flavorful and including the fried dough to dip!  Prices are very reasonable. The congee and fried dough cost me about $6 for a nice hearty breakfast.
4 If you want to get away from the hustle and bustle that is Chinatown, then Big Wong King is not the place to go.  It is just as crowded as the street outside (perhaps more so), and it is definitely not quiet.  You most probably will have to share a table with another group, and if you are part of a big group, you will have to wait a while.  However, if you want really good Cantonese food, Big Wong King is the place to go.  I love their noodle soups, and I can really recommend the duck (unless you don't like having to deal with the bones) and the pork.  Their egg rolls are also wonderful.  Friends of mine who are into congee really love this place.  I'm not really a fan of congee, so I cannot personally say if it is good or not.  The wait staff are quick in two ways:  One, you will not find a chatty waitress here.  They will answer your questions as best they could, but they will strictly be "What do you want?"  Two, they will get your food to you quickly.  Despite being crowded and chaotic, I have often been surprised at how fast the food came to our table, and they have never messed up an order, at least for me.  The prices are very decent, and you get a lot of food for the money.  I have always left full and happy.
1 The waiters r so rude & didn't care about the customers at all. The food r ok but not that great. If u r going with your family, don't go there. But if u r buying noodle soup or taking out by yourself, it's OK.
4 Delicious food in an authentic Chinatown setting. The food is served quickly and all at once so if you would like to eat at a leisurely pace, order a few dishes at a time.
5 I love their wonton soup, the sliced roast pork and all the jokes I can make with the restaurants name.  I've been going here for at least 30 years just for those three things.
4 Authentic Cantonese "diner" food. Big Wong's one of the classic establishments in Chinatown and I've been a patron for nearly a decade. Now I feel old.  Sure, it's not the greatest atmosphere with its no-frills and almost dingy feel, but you can't beat the food - super tasty and super cheap. If you're a real foodie, this is one of the best places I can think of to sample good home style Canto cuisine. If you need better service, dining tablecloths or if you're bringing tourists, take them to the Shanghai restaurant next door that is inexplicably always full of non-locals.  I don't usually get their entree dishes and instead opt for what they call "cold" meats with rice - crispy pork, bbq pork, duck, and (soy sauce) chicken. No veggies, but the meat choices are fantastic and marinated to perfection. A great meal way under $10 per person.
4 This place was my fave restaurant for roast duck. Tender, crisp and flavorful. I always pair that dish with some ginger scallion. You can also order the duck with noodles too! Also a recommended dish. In combination, I would also order the Chinese broccoli or Choy sum. This place is very Typical Chinese restaurant, but note that the prices are higher with growing business and being located in NYC Chinatown versus food of the same flavor located in Brooklyn or Queens. Serving size is also smaller for duck, chicken and char siu. But quality is always good. (Quality over quantity!)
4 You don't come to this (or most Chinatown restaurants) for the service, decor or ambiance. It's the food and price, the latter of which is quite refreshing among the many overpriced restaurants in NYC. I can't comment on how Big Wong has improved or gone down over these many years since I just don't remember. I usually come here for the congee (seafood or thousand-year-old egg) and fried dough, roast pork, fried noodles, and various other hot rice dishes. The service does seem to be better if you speak Chinese, which is also quite common in this area. If it's crowded, you may be seated at a table with strangers, but again, you're here for the food. The service is also very fast, as they make the money on turning over tables. I'll continue to return!
4 Big Wong, a gem of a restaurant.  Let's talk a how I found this place.  Years ago I was introduced to Sun Lok Kee further down Mott Street.  They were so small yet so popular with everyone from tourists to locals.  There was almost always a line out the door.  Anyway they lost their lease and moved to Flushing and I followed them there too lol.  Alas they lost their following and closed for good I'm told (unless you know something I dont?). So I've tried Wo Hop & Hop Kee and they just weren't my place.  So I was moping on Mott St one day thinking about my old love Sun Lok Kee and bumped into Big Wong.  How I've passed this place all these years I don't know.  I was feening like an addict for my favorite salt & pepper shrimp, saw their menu in the window, went in ordered and boy did they deliver.  The rice, the salt & pepper shrimp & pork chops, the spicy beef chow fun, the ramen noodles and the seafood have all been good to me.  I'm always staring at other people's dishes as well and everything just looks so heavenly.  Everything I've gotten here to date has been good.  Sadly enough I always dive right into my plates and forget to take pics so I will do that next time I go.  Do not expect fancy fare, nice restrooms or great tables, but do expect delicious food you just can't get at the local Asian restaurant in your neighborhood unless you live near Chinatown or in Asia somewhere lol.  My testament to great food is seeing more people of Asian descent there than not.  I definitely recommend this place for great food.
3 not bad for breakfast duck is best
2 I'm sad to report that this place has gone down and has received a grade C from the Heath inspection. Sadly after 10 years of dining at this place I will not be coming back.
4 This place is old school, meaning it's been around for a very long time and draws back old time customers, and also maintains its retro look. The restaurant interior hasn't changed a bit according to my friends and family who have been frequenting this place for the past 10+ years.   The roast duck, roast pork, and soy sauce chicken are always visible in the window up front. All three are decent and packed with flavor. The last time I checked, half a roast duck is $22 and a whole duck is $40 (very typical Chinatown prices). Too bad they don't have roast pig for sale, I would get that too. They also make good one-dish rice/noodle plates like Young Chow Fried Rice, Beef Chow Fun, Singapore Chow Mee Fun, Salted Fish Chicken Fried Rice, Two Treasure Rice, and more (all around  $8 and filling for one adult). The host/hostess stand is always manned and seating/serving is quick. This isn't a dim sum restaurant but they have great morning food like congee, steamed rice rolls, and fried crullers. I love their Thousand Year Egg and Pork congee and steamed rice rolls with shrimp or fried cruller. You can get take out in a jiffy if you are in a rush too... it's amusing how fast staff can get you in and out of the restaurant!   So if you are looking for a quick bite in Chinatown and don't want to spend too much, this is the place to go whether breakfast, lunch, or dinner. The only cons are being not too sanitary (mostly the restroom) and depending on how busy they are, you may have communal seating. Also, don't sit around expecting the server to come get your bill, bring it up to the host/hostess stand and pay up there.
1 This morning bought the fried dough and fish congee, fried dough is not fresh, you can smell the old oil, fish congee was super disappointed, congee no taste at all, fish not fresh, what happen to this place??? Changed owner?
4 No frills Cantonese diner style food-- super quick and cheap. Make sure you bring cash!
2 Went here a while back and wasn't impressed with the roast meat (can't remember what I ordered back then) but figured that I should give it another chance given all the laudatory reviews.  Well, went tonight and had the soup with roast duck and pork. Didn't like the flavor of either--in particular, the duck had a heavy dull flavor. The soup itself wasn't all that great. The pork was surprisingly chewy; the duck leg virtually meatless and accompanied by two small tender pieces. Won't complain about the quantity since it was a mere $8 with tax, but won't be returning.
4 The duck here is always good. Decent Chinese style service - quick, efficient, low expectation.
1 I came here to get takeout for dinner tonight and I was extremely disappointed.  I've been here too many times to count and this place has always been my go to when I wanted some authentic Cantonese food, specifically the roast pork + duck rice.  Tonight, I ordered a duck over rice.  I got 4 measly tiny pieces that barely had any meat on it.  The entire thing was 99% rice and practically no meat.  Please see the picture attached to my review.  I am extremely disappointed in Big Wong for having the audacity to serve dishes like this to their customers.  I don't know what they were thinking when they were chopping up the pieces for me and putting it on top of the rice.  I was basically given the scraps of the duck.  No one in their right mind would call this acceptable.  I should have taken a look at the rice before I left so it was too late for me to complain in person.  The rice that came with the duck was also old rice.  You could taste it was hard and was probably sitting around the entire day.    I also ordered a roast pork over rice.  This came with more roast pork pieces, but the roast pork was no where near the quality that Big Wong is known for.  The roast pork was dry and tasteless.  The rice was the same as above, hard and old.    You would think, how can one possibly mess up these two dishes?  It's pretty hard to mess up rice and the meats since all you're doing is slicing it up and putting it on top of rice. Well, tonight, Big Wong has failed miserably.  I will not be back.  I can not believe I wasted my money tonight and Big Wong thought what they served me was acceptable.  You do not skimp out on the portion size and definitely do not provide old food to your loyal customers.  I am sure this is a result of carelessness and selfishness because this place has grown in popularity and ratings in the past few years due to media exposure and reviews and they have earned their money.  This popularity has apparently gone to their heads since they don't care about presentation and what they are serving to their customers.  Big Wong, I will not be back.  You just lost yourself a very loyal customer.
5 I've only ever gotten the "ngao lei so" here (don't know if that's the correct spelling) and that's all that really matters because it's the bomb. It's basically like a giant Chinese doughnut. Or if you know what "you tiao" is, it's like that, but made into a circle, with sweetened bits in the middle. Basically, deliciousness. It's $1.25 for one, which is enough to feed a few people, because it's sinfully greasy (as doughnuts are) and filling. The porridge and duck and you tiao they sell also look good, but what I know for sure is that the ngao lei so is great!
4 CASH ONLY PLACE!! Not a fancy place or anything but if you're looking for cheap food, this is the place to go to. I ordered the wonton noodle soup with duck and paid $3 extra to add beef tripe in it. The meal was pretty satisfying and filling and the food comes out pretty quick. I would definitely come here again and try other food. Heard the congee here is pretty good.
3 First time here with two friends, and we had a mixed experience. The roasted meats were great: BBQ duck, and pork ribs. Other dishes we had: Sesame chicken was horrible: consistency of microwaved food and the chicken did not taste like chicken. Boiled spareribs dish was ok, but very bland. So I guess you need to know which dishes to order that are consistently good. Service was ok. Place not very clean, as others had mentioned. My plate had stains of old food. Bathroom had a slippery, oily floor. Good prices though, so 3 stars.
5 This place has been here since the beginning of time. Granted, it has become a little touristy due to its location on Mott street. But hey, prices are still reasonable and you can never say no to some good old school canto fast food.  BBQ pork rice is my to go to.
5 I've been coming to this Chinatown staple since I was a child in the late 80s. It has been consistent for decades, and that is something utterly unique in NYC. I now have an institution of going every year with friends after halloween.  Service will be rushed, food will come out in minutes, check will be unceremoniously dumped on the table before you're finished eating. If you don't have an experience like this in Chinatown, don't bother calling yourself a New Yorker.  Boiled Chicken with Ginger Scallion - this is a must order for any table. I have no idea how they can make the chicken so tender (I think it involves pressure cooking), but it's utterly unreplicatable. Other places in chinatown WISH they could make chicken like this. And the ginger-scallion sauce...well, let's just say I have dreams about this sauce that are illegal in some flyover states.  Crepes - they come in a variety of fillings; I prefer shrimp, but lots of people love the creuller version. Glutinous and sticky with sweet soy. Get it.  Wonton soup with roast duck and mein noodle - This is my standard order. I would stake Big Wong's wontons with any in town. Giant toothful chunks of pork and shrimp in each bite. You will probably not be able to finish the head-sized portion of noodles, but dammit, you're going to try.  Roast Pork - meat candy. MEAT CANDY.  Crueller - generally ordered by people who want congee (the place's signature dish next to the two lobsters with ginger-scallion), but take my friend's method. Piece of creuller, ginger scallion, dip in wonton soup. Hold on, I'm getting a call - hi, heaven, how's it going? Naw, I'm going to stick around here a while longer, this dipped crueller needs my attention.  The congee and the larger orders of standards like fried rice, lo mein, etc all have their benefits, but go with the above order, and you and 2 friends will have the greatest weekend lunch of your life. And pay pennies for it. Screw brunch. Get big wong.
5 Decent Cantonese style food.  I came all the way from Grand Central to have some Beef Chow Fun.  It was $8.  Loved every bit of it.  I don't mind making this trip again in case I forget to bring lunch to work.
5 This is an authentic Chinese experience. Their duck congee was amazing and very inexpensive by New York standards.
5 Classic Cantonese foodery specializing in roast meats and Chinese comfort foods, this is as authentic as it gets! You walk in and all the roast meats greet you as you gaze at them dripping out all the fat underneath. What's left is a mouthwatering flavorful meaty goodness that awaits consumption.  This isn't fancy, just no-frills, and quick swift service. You get a glass of classic black Pu-Erh tea as you are seated and they take your order right away. Don't think too hard. Order the first thing that catches your eye. You can't go wrong with anything here. Roast Meats over rice, Wonton Noodle Soup (which is the classic Shrimp and Pork), Congee, Stir Fry over rice, Noodles are the winners here. The rice crepes are delicious here too but they tend to run out early but I still ask every time when I'm there later just in case.  It's an experience in itself and nice too see that it retains it's old Chinatown charm after so many years. Don't ever change, Big Wong!
4 Pretty good Cantonese food. Had the roast duck (super oily and fatty, have had better in Philly), Chinese veggies, thousand year old egg congee, and beef noodle stir fry. Cash only so be prepared!
4 This place has become my Sunday brunch staple. Just really great, solid, cheap HK style Chinese food. I will say that if you are not used to that kind of ambience (i.e. not exactly the cleanest, dimly lit, cardboard on the ground, everyone busy and bustling, being seated with randos at any table that has space) it can be something of a turn off. But for those who grew up with it, its really a little piece of Mongkok or SF Chinatown.   The service, again although not fancy, is very efficient and good. Every time my friends and I have gone, they are super accommodating in terms of switching up the order - changing the noodles, adding more beef and less tendon, etc.   The food is also excellent. Service is very fast - I've never had to wait to be seated (I've usually come in parties of 3) and the food comes out in minutes. The soup noodle broth is amazing and the rice dishes super filling. You never leave hungry.
5 My family and I have been coming here for year. We've enjoyed the Roast Duck and the Roast Pork with congree. The Roast Spare Ribs and the Chicken Feet are delicious. They only service the Chicken feet during the morning rush. Great Food,  Great Prices and Great Service
5 I think I was around 8 years old when my parents started taking my brothers and I down to Big Wong's. My mom & dad would drive to Chinatown every Sunday so that they can do their food shopping - but we would always go to Big Wong's for lunch or dinner.   Very authentic dishes.  My all-time favorite is the duck/chicken over rice with a fried egg on the side.  The beef/chicken fried noodles are delicious too!  I mean its not the classiest looking restaurant, but who cares right as long as the food is good and the service is quick...  =)
5 I went in for take out and i ordered the roast pork over rice with a sunny side up eggs on top, can you picture that? Juicy succulent well seasoned pork sliced to bite size portions over freshly steamed rice and when you poke the egg on top the yolk, slowly spills over the rice and pork providing a perfect sauce for your every bite. This is heavenly, if i lived nearby i would eat here ALL the time..
4 I'm a Big fan of Big Wong (I don't know anyone who calls it Big Wong King). I can't speak for the entirety of the menu because every time I've frequented this establishment I always order the lobster special, which comes with two whole lobsters with ginger and scallions for $28. It's more than enough to share between two people and is such a great deal. Sides are generally very affordable, my favorites being the eggplant in a black bean sauce and the steamed bok choy. The sauteed Chinese broccoli is also very good.   On my most recent excursion to Big Wong's my friend ordered the green mustard with sliced pork soup but said that it had little flavor. Other than that everything tasted delicious.  Service is quick and friendly enough, but depends on the server. Most speak enough English to answer simple questions you may have about the menu. In terms of decor, Big Wong's is one step above a hole in the wall, so don't expect good china and silver spoons.
4 If you are around the area, and looking for Chinese quick cheap and tasteful food. This is the place to go to.
5 Came here for breakfast and got the triple treasure rice (I know this is pretty heavy for breakfast). Roast chicken, char siu and fried egg over rice, with seasoned scallion and ginger.   The char siu is sadly on the fattier side and they gave me chicken breast for the roasted chicken. Both flavors are really good and the sauce that came with them is so good with rice.  I can't really complain for a yummy $6.50 dish. Will come back if I come to NYC again
3 The food taste good,  the  service is sloppy and I also needed to remind my waiter to get my drinks after he asked "what you wanted to drink.?"The tables were dirty . I was surprised the place was crowed with people yet the restaurant is located in a busy part of Manhattan and  every other restaurant i was interested in was over crowed.
3 I've been going there for years. Love the noodles. But wait to you are finished before using the bathroom. Very unappetizing.
4 Real Cantonese restaurant. It serves everything on the menu as it opens at 8:30, which is unheard of in Hong Kong. Usually restaurant only offer breakfast menu and don't serve full menu until 11. I am very happy to find this place for Chinese early breakfast
2 We came here in search of roast duck and were generally satisfied but I'm confident other places can deliver better. The type of duck you could get is either the normal roast duck you see hanging on the store fronts or a soy sauce marinated duck. While the flavored are decent, there isn't much meat on each piece and the quantity of fat is enormous. If you order a rice and meat dish, it is essentially a rice and fat dish.  Their barbecue pork however is pretty tasty, especially when you have it in one of their rice rolls. Sometimes you'll hit that piece of crispy skin...but only sometimes.
4 One of the Resturant keeping their foods in good standard and the service in over 35 years  !  So I would like give this Resturant four stars today !  Please try this Resturant if you came from the other states or countries !  You will like their food and the price too !
4 Cheap, good food. Best roast pork in chinatown. really quick service. Only downside is that like most restaurants in chinatown they try to rush you out.
4 I know you guys might hate me after this one, but Big Wong has been a staple down in Chinatown for a while, and I was born and raised in NYC, so I've been coming here before I even knew what a foodie was or what fine-dining even meant. Sure, now I enjoy Michelin Stars and celebrity chefs as much as the next yelper, but that doesn't mean that I can disregard the flavorful foods I grew up on in dingy establishments either.   Big Wong was clutch whenever I was in a rush and needed a quick plate of food on the go. I'd come in and order the roast pork with a fried egg on it and white rice plate for $4. I'm sure it's probably about $5 or a little more now, but it was delicious, and to be quite candid I still eat it now every time I get a craving and I happen to be downtown.   I get it, the place looks trashy, but have you walked around Chinatown? This will never go through the whole Williamsburg gentrification that happened in the last decade or so, and frankly I sure hope it doesn't. Chinatown is great because of how it is, and I'd love to keep it that way, so that at least some part of the NYC I grew up in remains, and remains consistent.   Big Wong's, I love you, and to all you fancy shmancy elite foodie snobs out there: get over yourselves and give it a break. You're the only fools complaining because those that don't or haven't liked it in the past just never went back, so stay away and enjoy your Mr. Chow's.    拜拜啦! (bài bài la): Bye bye!
5 If I could describe my childhood with one dish, it would probably be a bowl of duck and broad noodles from Big Wong.   It's kinda dingy, and the service isn't the greatest, but god damn the food is spot on. Everything here is solid.  Roast pork, roast duck, cha sui, soy sauce chicken with the best condiment known to man, ginger scallion. The lean pork and thousand year old egg congee is a must try with the fried crueler. The dim sum is pretty decent too!  For the price you pay here, you get solid and good homestyle food.
4 Always Come Here For The Duck & Pork. Quick, Cheap, And Fills Me Up. Ill Keep Coming Back Time And Time Again.
1 DISGUSTING!!!  The place was filthy; the floor was literally covered in grease.  This place used to be amazing years ago; now the food is vile.  We ordered & didn't eat 4 out of the 4 dishes.  How anyone could possibly think this restaurant is even passable is hard to understand.  There are countless places in Chinatown with at least decent food.
4 Not the cleanest place nor has the best service. But you don't come to places like this for that. You come for the delicious food! I ordered the pork and thousand year old egg congee.   SOOO GOOD! It was still bubbling when it arrived. Just added a dash of white pepper.  And I was in congee heaven. This congee is on the thicker side than runny/thin consistency. It was smooth and not chunky. Perfect congee!   Be ready to speak Cantonese too! If you're Asian, the staff assumes you're a Cantonese speaker.
4 Big Wong is my favorite place to get roast pork in all of NYC. The flavor here for some of their roast meats cannot be beat. The atmosphere, the flavor, the plates, chairs, tables, feel very "old school Chinatown", like the place hasn't changed for the past 20 years.   The service isn't the best here, but the food really makes up for it.
4 I cannot begin to tell how many time I been here over the years. I have been eating their cha siu fan (Roast Pork over Rice) for so long. No matter where I go somehow I always come back to this place. The food is extremely cheap and I would always end up recommending this place first. Service is quick and simple. The place has not changed much over the years and that is fine because it gives me the feels everytime I come back in.  I had the King Soy Sauce Chow Mein, roast pork, roast duck, soy sauce chicken, beef stew with egg noodles, and a lot more. Everything is great if you compare the amount you are getting to the price you are paying. If you end up getting lost and no where to go in Chinatown, rest easy and come over to Big Wong King for some great food.  Recommendation: Roast Pork/Roast Duck/Chicken over Rice with a fried egg or just get all three over rice Stewed Beef Brisket and Tendon w/ egg noodles King Soy Sauce Chow Mein Beef Pan Fried Noodles
4 Don't expect the place to look clean or nice or the waiters to look presentable. You go here, you eat their good food, and you leave. The food here comes out quick, its fresh, and its very authentic. Duck, Chicken, congee, all their food tastes great. My favorite thing to get here is the congee and the duck.  If you don't want to sit around and enjoy their "beautiful" restaurant, just get take out and go. The price is cheap and you'll get your food almost instantly. I've been eating here from 20 years ago to now, still the same great taste.
1 I ordered something I didnt know, then I literally put a plate on the food cause it looked so disgusting. Now i am walking on the street and want to vomit
5 Big Wong's, through a few incarnations, have been here for a long time. The business model for this place is a little different from the rest of CTown & it works. Don't know why it's not copied because it's simple. Higher quality & higher prices. Prices are ~20-30% higher than the average CTown cheap place but probably the best Cha-Siu (roast pork) in Manhattan. The Siu-Arp (roast duck) is fabulous. The place is not fancy so in that sense, it's like the rest of Chinatown. But the food is top notch.  Jimmy O Yan was here:  youtu.be/ff5My2fFD28
5 My favorite place to get roast pork noodle soup and 3 combo rice!
5 Delicious food and good service. The food arrived promptly, and the restaurant is also fairly clean.
2 The floor was so greasy I nearly fell down. That should have been the tip-off. Very mediocre food. Lots better places in Chinatown.
4 service quite well and quick, food also not bad, and the roast duck is add  a lot of points! However the environment is too noise, some people may not like it like me.
4 This place is a no fuss, bare minimum place. You won't receive any pleasantries here, but the service is very quick. You could potentially be out the door within 20 minutes from the time you enter.  Definitely get something that has the roast duck or pork - or both!
4 Owner definitely doesn't know me, but I know him and that's all that matters. Well, I know who he is, and I love the vibe he gives off. The guy is always hard at work by the register whether it's packing up the food, taking orders, collecting $.. You name it. He's also so friendly and never once have I seen him give anyone an attitude.   Food itself always hits the spot for me too. I wouldn't say I love everything here, but whenever I do crave for cha siu, or soy sauce chicken, or beef stew - this place does it right. Ordered two cha siu steamed rice noodle plates for $4 total this morning for breakfast and it was so worth it. $2 per order is dirt cheap and the noodles were hot, light, and fresh.
5 Been eating here for 30 yrs. Best roast duck, soy sauce chicken, and spare ribs. I should knock off a star because of their restrooms but the review is on the food.
3 I've been coming here for 25+ years. Consistent.   The best Beef chow fun in the city. Ask for spicy.
2 I would give it 5 stars for the Grossest Restroom Ever. Overpriced, soul-less, no decor. They did give us a big fried dough thing at the end of the meal ( I think one of the younger staff had sympathy).
3 Came here for authentic cheap Cantonese food in Chinatown for the Two lobster deal is $28. Food was great but the sanitation wasn't the best.. Which is why this place only gets three stars! Cash only!
4 Excellent food, very good prices.  I'd give it 5 stars except for their unusual seating policy.  I came in with a party of 5 and they sat us at a round table with 2 strangers. Uncomfortable.  But can't beat the quality or prices!
5 It's been EONS since I've been here, so I went back today. The cantonese pork lo mein is my jam. The veggie egg rolls are also quite good. Ate like a QUEEN for $11.  Cash only, they have an ATM if you're sans cash. Food comes out super quick. Waiters are efficient and non-pesky.  Definitely worth fighting the hordes of tourists looking for fake bags and Little Italy to get here.
5 I love it here. I always get the duck dish when I go here but I also love their congee and lobster dish as well. The service is also great. The waiters are always ready for you and the food comes out quickly. The price is good for the meal and the dishes are big enough to share with a group of ppl.
5 Roast pork, roast duck, fried breadsticks, congee... Seriously comforting, delicious, honest food.   Seating and service are quick. Tea comes out piping hot in glasses. Congee comes out  quickly and steaming. I have tried the beef and the roast duck congee, but the roast pork congee is my favorite by far.   The fresh shrimp in rice crepes are a great side, the roast pork ones are really good too, but I love most things on the menu. The sautéed Chinese broccoli is really good. The soy sauce chicken is absolutely delicious. The stewed tripe is really tender and savory. Whenever I come to New York, Big Wong is on my "must visit" list.   Whether you bring friends or go by yourself, I would highly recommend this restaurant should you decide to venture into Chinatown. See pics.
5 Roast pork/white meat chicken combo with extra ginger scallion sauce. Best meal in the world
2 Very authentic casual Cantonese food. The best dishes were Chinese barbecue (roast duck, roast pork and soy sauce chicken), congee and noodle soup. All other dishes were OK, but did not stand out.  Service and cleanliness, on the other hand, were questionable. Their bathrooms were in the basement and one of the worst I have ever seen. Once, a waiter coughed on the food while bringing it out!
4 I have been coming back here for roast duck. $10 half a duck, $20 a whole duck. It's a fairly busy restaurant. People working here are friendly, serving is fast.
5 You know what I just found out? Mr. Lee (the elder) has retired. I cried a little, inside and out. Upon hearing this, other customers were visibly moved, too.  For the better part of the past 17 years, I had been going to this restaurant twice a day (breakfast and lunch), every single Saturday. Mr. Lee was always there at around 6:30 a.m., regardless of the fact that the restaurant didn't open until 7 a.m. Mr. Lee represents (in the non-legal sense) the best of the Chinese immigrants - he was probably constantly standing, running around, answering phones, taking orders, chatting with customers, etc. for at least 13 hours per day. The background business stuff, he probably had to handle with little or no help, another two hours per day. So all in all, he probably worked fifteen hours a day, six to seven days a week, for the past, oh, 38 years (got this number from his colleague; verified it with an old customer). He never appeared to complain. He probably worked through exhaustion and beyond. Then he worked some more.  Above all, he was a phenomenal human being. Just a few weekends ago, I came in (probably looking like heck) and ordered $30 worth of take-out and he gave me a soda. Look, that soda, at cost, was probably $0.05, but it bought a huge amount of goodwill. 15-16 years ago, I was working with the Transfiguration Chinese School to raise funds for our yearbook so that each child would have to pay less. He bought an advertisement, even though he said that he's never had to advertise before and really had no budget set aside for it. Sure, the cost of the advertisement was "merely" $150 (the things I remember), but again, lots of goodwill. Finally, he and his wife (who also worked her rear end off there) were able to raise two children, one of whom I had the pleasure of meeting as an undergraduate (small world) and is another wonderful human being - the apple does not fall far from the tree. [Anita, if you see this, please translate it for your parents. Thanks].  I will miss Mr. Lee. I congratulate him on owning (I think) and building the best all-around restaurant serving fast Cantonese fare in Chinatown. I bet many of the other chains that use the same formula are his, too. Next time you think that you're tired of sitting in your office for nine hours a day, think about Mr. Lee, and all of those immigrants who came to New York City to build businesses and contribute to society. Mr. Lee is an example of the true grit that it takes to really succeed - it really matters little whether you're exceedingly educated, nobody gives a flying fecal matter if you don't work hard, too.  Yes, the best duck and roast pork in all of Chinatown lives on! This restaurant is not closing anytime soon, I bet, and this is no obituary, Mr. Lee is just moving on to the next chapter of his life.   Cheers to the next 38+ years!
3 I only come here to eat one thing:  The thousand year old egg with salted pork rice porridge and fried breadstick (youtiao). Okay, perhaps that is technically two things but those two go together so well. I grew up in chinatown and get excited when my mom brings this home as a treat! You dip the youtiao into the rice porridge. They also give you a healthy serving of thousand year old egg and salted pork.   Otherwise, the service is medicore, the bathrooms are not that clean. My goal is to eat my fill and leave.
2 Disgusting. My brother killed a cockroach by stepping on it and as if we weren't disgusted by that one cockroach, there was another one climbing on the wall near us. It is understandable that restaurants have roaches but, two in one go is disgusting. The food was okay. They cooked us wrong dish even though we spoke to then in Chinese.
4 This place has been around as long as I have. Even as Chinatown has change this place has not. It's a old school quick bite type of joint. Be prepared to share a table with a stranger or two also. The roast pork and duck never fails but I also like to indulge in some wonton noodles with a side of duck. This is a establishment that I love going to and can't see myself going any other place for my fix of quick Asian food. Highly recommend
5 Lobster. Lobster. LOBSTERRR.  Came here with my parents and we ordered 2 wonton noodles, char siu noodles, and one order of the two lobsters.  The service was reallyyyy fast! Literally went to the bathroom to wash my hands and within 3 mins, the lobster plate was on the table!   Noodles: Nice and chewy, somewhat of what you'd expect from a good Chinese restaurant. Wontons were good, could sense a little MSG. Char siu was alrighttt, not as lean as I normally like it.  Lobster: This lobster doe..... OH. MAH. GAWD. It was deliciousssss! The lobster was all precut for you so it was easy to get the meat out. Taste/flavors were divine, juicy, sweet and tender meat. I always knew the Chinese knew how to prepare lobster the best.   That lobster is a done deal, 2 lobsters for $35. I'd be back for that lobster forrsureee.
4 Had the preserved egg/pork congee and duck rice noodle soup. Service was minimal, but we were tired from a long day of walking around the city and actually appreciated being given the space. The congee tasted exactly as I thought it would in the classic way. It was not amazing, but satisfied my craving. I would say the same about the duck noodles. If you're hungry, the portions are pretty generous: lots of duck meat and the congee bowl was huge.  I would come back again for a cozy, traditional Asian meal, but I probably wouldn't bring anyone besides the bf here.
4 The food here is always pretty consistent. The portions are large and filling and the prices are very cheap.  PROS: -Noodles: So amazing. I've tried the won ton, the look fun, ho fun.... and all have a bouncy chewy texture (not mealy and soft) and taste so fresh.  -Vegetables: The sauteed chinese brocolli is amazing. It's crunchy and so flavorful and full of roasted garlic. Really the perfect side to a bowl of noodles -Tendon: I'm pretty obsessed with tendon and Big Wong does not disappoint! Their tendons are really soft and savory with none of those weird crunchy parts you sometimes get.  -Congee: Gelatinous, warm, perfect for winter. Also less than 5$!  -Price: All the noodle soups are around 5-6$, so you really can't beat that for a satisfying lunch. CONS: -Service: Predictably, you're not going to be coddled at all. They pretty much expect you to just pay, eat, and not complain hah.  -Hot Tea: It can be SO HOT that it'll burn your tongue... so be careful!
3 Everything is priced very reasonably, especially for New York prices. The service is very very fast. You do not wait long for your carry out orders or food to arrive at your table. Unfortunately it can get a bit chaotic during peak meal times
1 Big Wong King? More like Big Failure!  For the record, my impression of BWK used to be great, and although service has always been crap, I found the food always of good value. However, recently, I realise its Yelp ratings have dropped and customers are dwindling and the restaurant don't even seem to care. Gone were the days where it was filled to the brim and you have to wait for a table and there can only be one reason why.  The food is getting from bad to worse. My decision to bring my visiting chinese relatives here was the greatest mistake ever! We decided to order ala carte dishes and each dish was at least 3 times more expensive than their value single plate dishes. We ordered string bean veg, lychee duck and sweet and sour pork. The lychee duck was in fact just roast duck draped in a tomato-based sweet and sour sauce and littered with a few pathetic pieces of canned lychees. The sauce nor the duck had any hint of lychee in it. The only redeeming factor was that the roast was soft, but the dish still felt like a frankenstein combination of different ingredients with no coherence at all.  The worst was the sweet and sour pork, which was draped in EXACTLY THE SAME sauce as the bad lychee duck. I don't know whether it's pure laziness or what but apparently they have decided to cook both dishes that cost more than $30 in exactly the same sauce with none living up to its suggested name! A traditional sweet and sour pork should be pork perfectly caramelized and crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The crap they serve at BWK was overcooked and tasteless and tough pieces of pork wrapped in a thick fried dough and draped with the same 'lychee duck sauce' (albeit without the lychee'. It's despicable enough that they may try to pass this devilish doughy dumpling pork as traditional sweet and sour pork, but to us chinese, this is just a pure disgrace. I don't even understand how they don't feel ashamed of themselves at all for serving this crap, because I feel so so ashamed for them, and deeply embarrassed on my part for recommending this place to my relatives.  Service was worse than ever. They keep banging into us for no reason or dropping things randomly and loudly and unapologetically on our table or distributing plates to us like frisbee. Why can't ANYONE in the restaurant just take a least bit of pride in their work and business?? and they still have the cheek to ask for tip when we try to give them what they deserve i.e. no tip. Overall, for the embarrassment i suffered for recommending this place, i have to right the wrong by recommending Yelp users to AVOID THIS PLACE LIKE A PLAGUE!!
5 I like their beef and peas. I have beem coming here since I was a little kid. Their roast duck is good as well.
4 Got takeout here with a buddy of mine and was happy that he brought me here.  It's a small mom and pop shop and you can order food to go or dine in.  I ordered the half duck/half roast port over rice and cabbage as well as congee with preserved egg and pork.  Both dishes were awesome.  If you've never tired duck, it's something you need to try once.  The crispy skin and the dark meat go well together and they give you a good amount of meat.  For both the congee and the pork/duck dish, it came out to around 10 dollars, which is a steal.  If you're ever in the area, I would highly recommend you stop by.
4 This is my place when I feel carnivorous for Roast Duck and Pork.  Then I balance out the taste with Seafood Pan Fried Noodles and the chicken, pork squid congee combo.   I'll be lucky if I can have room for anything else without wearing my stretchy pants.
4 It's not a comfortable place to eat in but I love their pork and chicken over rice. It's just so good.  Hole in a wall kind of place.  Good and cheap but not the best service. I suggest taking out.
5 My dad came here when he was a kid over thirty years ago. If that doesn't give you a hint as to the quality of this place, then I don't know what to tell you. Of course, note that I said quality, not cleanliness. As with most of Chinatown, it's not that clean. You're not going to get the standard pleasantries you would at a western restaurant either. At the same time, I've never found them particularly rude. They were very friendly the first time I took a couple of my friends, and they asked us where we went to school, etc. Maybe it helps if you speak Chinese?   I don't go for the five star service though. I go to Dai Wong because it's a Chinatown classic and still serves authentic Chinese food, regardless of all the tourists. The roast duck is so, so good...like, sublime almost. The juk is great (and with the crispy, oily yau jia gwai), and my dad always used to bring it home whenever he came back from a trip to NYC. I've gotten wonton noodles too, and they were good. I don't think you can go wrong here, though I would say the roast duck is one of their best, if not the best, dishes.  The best part is that it's cheap. I can get the ultimate comfort food - food from my childhood - for under $10 a person. Usually, it works out to $7-8 per person, and we don't even finish all of our food. It's pretty hard to do better than Dai Wong.
3 A little disappointed in this place after coming here for years. Recently craving some roast pork and cold chicken, they ran out of roast pork, so I had the roast duck. The duck and chicken were just ok. My friend ordered their wonton soup with noodles. The broth was a little off. The wontons were good but not their noodles. The quality was never high but it was still good, that's why I kept coming back, but after this last meal, I probably won't be back in a while. Sorry Big Wong, you're belly gotten full and forgotten about your roots.
3 I love Cantonese food and had high expectations for Big Wong because of all the reviews but only found it to be average. I got the Roast duck over rice for $5.25 and while it is a pretty good deal for a meal, it was mostly rice with a few pieces of duck on top. Some pieces of duck were mostly bone but others had more meat. I've definitely had better duck before at Cantonese restaurants in Brooklyn but I do like how Big Wong's duck isn't as greasy.  This place got a B rating but to me, it didn't seem unnecessarily dirty. Way cleaner than Wah Fung, even though Wah Fung has better deals on meals lmao. Service is very quick despite the long lines and is also fairly friendly. Would I come back? Maybe, cause I love Cantonese food haha.
3 Great place for a cheap congee fix! No frills and not the cleanest place around but remains a great way to get some comfort chow!
3 I have been coming to this place last ten years. Its really popular for their duck. Food here is delicious. You dont expect much when you first come in. The service is always hit or miss. They could be rude or friendly to you. After all these years I stopped paying attention to that. I come strictly to satisfy my chinese food craving. They have reasonable pricing here. What I do like is their food comes fast even if they are really busy. Least they give you quick service. Duck here is good as I mentioned before. I personally love their beef chow fun, green veggie side dish and chicken & veggies. I will mention their food is always consistent. Thats a big comfort. Another heads up their bathroom is just awful so dont be surpised there.
5 Loved here. Best place found in China Town. Quickest service ever. Loved lobster and Seaseme chicken. It is in a convenient location and is authentic Chinese food
5 TL;DR The leader in Cantonese Barbecue.    This is one of those spots foodies dream of landing on through self discovery:  1. Great food (check) 2. Authentic (check) 3. Serving the neighborhood for decades (check) 4. Super affordable (check) 5. Owner is still there (check)  If this place was a pizza joint they would call it Di Fara's.  If they sold pastrami sandwiches it would be called Katz.  Actually it would still be called Big Wong, cause when Big Wong makes a move, the entire industry makes a move.  Seriously  all other cantonese restaurants in chinatown base their pricing on what Big Wong prices are.  If Big Wong increases their duck by 50 cents all the restaurants take notice.  This is one of those places I never want to see go away and one day give it the Katz treatment (buy the place or building and make sure rent is never an obstacle).  I'm actually not sure if they even need that because they probably already did it.    When you step in the service is a lot like Peter Luger's, the waiters are no nonsense and ask you how many people.  They sit you and give you 2 minutes to decide.  For the most part I only need 10 seconds because the cantonese barbecue is what I came for aka "cold dishes served on rice".  For all the guai lows (if you don't know what that means you probably are one) don't let that name fool you.  That's just a horrible translation they did probably back in the 70s.  This is the section with all the cantonese barbecue.    You're going to be safe picking any of the Roast Pork combinations. Try the duck, soy sauce chicken, and chicken.  It never fails.  Add an egg if you want more protein.  They cook it over easy, so the yolk can burst all over your rice like a virgin having sex for the first time.  And really if it's the first time you're having cantonese barbecue, it'll be pretty close to having an orgasm in your mouth.  The dish comes out in less than 5 minutes.  Your two meats will be piled over the rice and the egg on the side.  They poured a bit of soy sauce over the rice before placing the meats on top.  The flavors, oils, and sauces of the meat are slowly flavoring the top part of the rice.  Take the egg gently and pop the yolk over the roast pork.  Literally drizzle it all over the roast pork.  Then part the pork by the crevices and let the egg yolk cascade down the pork and onto the rice.  The yolk takes some of the pork flavors and further flavors the rice.  Now you're ready to eat.    oh god i think i just...ooooaaaeeahhghhhh....................................... : /  ok i think i need a cigarette.
3 Came here for a new year dinner with a cousin.  had lobster (this is the second time we had this - the previous version was better), pea sprouts, steamed chicken and fried rice. good food.
4 The price is really good for the amount and quality of the food they serve. They serve tea and miso before every plate you order, so it was really good for the cold.
4 The cleanliness loses a star otherwise this place would receive 5 stars! I remember coming here when I was really young because my sister brought me here. The weather today wasn't good, so as I was coming to chinatown, I was craving congee. Then I remember my sister bringing me here. It's been over 5 years since I last came here, but I still remember the place because the food was delicious! I ordered the roast duck congee today, and it was just splendid! I forgot to tell the waiter I didn't want scallion and ginger, but I was able to pick them or myself.  You can tell that the roast duck was marinated by just tasting it. I think the congee itself was plain, I'm not sure, but with the roast duck in the congee, the congee was so flavorful! The waiter was extremely nice and informational too, he recommended me the fried dough with the congee, but I don't like the fried dough in general.  The price is very reasonable and the portion was filling as well. I would definitely come back here again the next time I crave for congee.
4 I've been coming to this place for years!!! I remember In high school my mom used to come here to get roast pork or duck for dinner.  You can come here for breakfast, lunch, or dinner and you will always find something good to eat. For breakfast, the congee with fried dough is good.  For lunch, their noodle soup with any of the bbq items are delicious. My favorite is the roast duck and a lot of people I know love their roast pork.  For dinner, any of the stir fried dishes are also good and all the prices are reasonable.  The place is definitely not fancy and honestly you can't really expect much from a real Chinese place. The staff are nice and the service is not bad at all. The take out line is usually pretty long but it moves really fast so you will get what you need in matter of few minutes. I no longer live in Chinatown but i come here whenever I can.
3 For some reason, Big Wong King is popular among tourists and high school Asian kids.  Well no, there is a reason.  It's super cheap, super basic, and super fast.  It's your no frills, no service Chinese joint and you shoudn't expect more or less.  So 3 stars because you get what you pay for and you should totally come here not expecting a gourmet meal.  The food isn't bad - I've had the roast pork over rice and pork and black egg congee - basically the most basic food.  Have I mentioned basic enough in this review yet?  The roast pork is comparable to other places, though not as cheap or as good as Wah Fung #1 Fast Food (which is THE BEST for take out roast pork and rice).  The congee isn't as good as the best either... you can find better at Noodle Village down Mott or at Congee Village further out.  You can also get your broccoli and beef, beef chow fun, etc. here for a decent price and a decent taste.  Expect little to no service and expect to hail down your waiter.   Also, the restaurant is old and pretty dirty.  I wouldn't ever choose to come to Big Wong when there's much better places out there.
3 Perks: quick service (as in I ordered, and food came in a MINUTE), to-the-point (like all chinese restaurants), cheap. Cons: food tastes too bland yet too salty at the same time. How is that possible? You will see.  Ordered: 1) fried chinese donut (would get again), 2) Jalurng - chinese donut wrapped within rice noodle (decent), 3) crispy seafood noodles ( $12, did not like the sauce but noodles were well made), 4) roast pork with chicken & rice (ok), 5) congee (ok).
4 Relatively cheap, good food here.  Don't be expected to be dazzled by the service or ambience here.  I came here for dinner with a friend and there was plenty of seating.  We walked right in and were seated -- the server was super quick with our order and the food came out fast too.  We got:  1) Beef chow fun --VERY GOOD. Thick rice noodles with tender beef. 2) Braised bean curd with veggies -- this is my favorite dish.  It came with broccoli, carrots, tofu and shitake mushrooms. Yum. 3) Kung pao chicken - veggies tasted super fresh and it wasn't overly spicy.  Sometimes Chinese food can leave you feeling extremely heavy and I didn't feel like that after this meal.  Definitely would recommend this place!
4 This is a staple in Chinatown for good old fashion Cantonese food. And you really can't beat the price. There's always a line for the roasted pork or roasted duck take out!
4 Some people got real balls talking about service here. Where the hell do you think you just walked into? You're in Chinatown and paid 6 bucks for a meal in the city. GTFOH!!!!! This place hands down is the OG of Chinese restaurants in CT. Where the gangsters used to frequent and meetings were held in the back somewhere, they could give 2 sh_ts what you think. Great food and no apologies for the decor, just how it's supposed to be done. You want service!? go somewhere else and pay triple that, damn tourists.....
2 This place was recommended to us as the place to try in chinatown. But regardless how good or cheap the food is and how big the portions are, if the restaurant lacks basic customer service and is dirty, it's impossible to get more than two stars...  If you go, do not visit the washrooms (on the way down you risk slipping on grease covered steps)... And do not look around; you risk discovering how dirty the restaurant really is.  As for the food, we had the lobster (cooked with ginger and scallions) and the duck. They were both good! However I now know better than to go back...!
4 If you are looking for a great traditional Chinese restaurant this place is it. Good food, fast service , cheap prices. It is not fancy at all and they make you sit with random people but the food is on point. I recommend the dumplings and hot and sour soup to start with.
1 Stay away from their sweet and sour chicken. Yuck!!! It wasn't good...it tasted like it was old and barely any chicken. The sauce was okay but it didn't help improve the taste of the chicken.  :( This one dish cost me $15.75...waste of money! I was highly disappointed because this restaurant is known to make good dishes.
4 I've been coming to big Wong ever since I was a kid. The food has been consistently good and tastes exactly as it did decades ago.   The prices have risen very slowly over the years but big Wong also happens to give slightly larger containers so the price increase is more than fair.   The only downsides are the place isn't that clean and the staff is very rude when you decide to eat in. If you ever try to keep the receipt, the staff will hunt you down. Also if you ever leave less than 15% even if the service is horrible, the staff will argue with you to leave double the tax.   All in all, the food is good and the prices are low so as long as you decide not to eat in, you'll be ok.
3 Quality has definitely gone down through the years. I used to love their roast pork and duck but it is not even half as good as it used to be. It's at most average. But I would go back cause its cheap, filling and yummy enough for lunch.
4 Kinky Friedman wrote about Big Wong in a few of his very funny, entertaining crime novels (the earlier ones the best of the bunch). I was walking in Chinatown, hungry as usual, and stumbled upon this place and decided I had to try it - purely based on the Kinkstah's recommendations.   Atmosphere? What atmosphere? It's a fast paced, Chinatown eatery - nothing more and certainly, nothing less. You sit and within seconds, someone comes by with tea and an order sheet. I ordered the very non-authentic-Chinese General TSO's chicken. My friend had Chicken with Broccoli. We both had Won Ton soup. What can I say? The food was delivered quickly. It was hot. It tasted great - like your mom would make, if she was Cantonese. And, best of all, it was cheap. Not NYC cheap - it was cheap cheap.   The tables were clean. The plates, utensils, tea cups and chop sticks were spotless. Not always true in some Chinatown restaurants.   If you want a true Chinatown experience and not spend a lot of money, try Big Wong.
4 YUM!!! I always want Big Wong when I am in Chinatown. Their roast duck is so good! and it is a cheap meal that is fast and delish!!   Their "Cow Tongue Pastry" is so good. Its basically the Chinese variation of the doughnut.
1 worse customer service ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  i will never go there no matter how good the food is and on top of that  he tried to overchaged me.
1 I come here for lunch at least twice a week because of their soup dumplings (XLB). Was just told that the owner took them off the menu because he was tired of hearing complaints from diners about them being "too thin" or some other combination of issues. I immediately stood up and left.    Seems silly and short-sighted to take off the one menu item with the most positive reviews and mentions. It's literally WHY people come to The Bao.   Instead, maybe the owner should get tougher skin or address whatever concerns people may have had with the soup dumplings. To me, they were phenomenal.   If they ever put them back on the menu I'll return, but for now they've lost a dedicated customer.
3 The restaurant serves good food. The staff is helpful and nice. However, the name is deceiving as they no longer serve Xiaolong Bao (removed from the menu recently) at the Astor place location.
3 This place doesn't serve soup dumplings anymore. Waitress urged us to try their dumplings "in soup" instead. They were good dumplings, but alas with each bite I was left with a mouth full of disappointment and the bitter taste of regret. Jk not bitter - and honestly good dumplings, but just not the savory soup dumplings we came expecting . Wish it didn't pop up with such thrilling reviews when searching soup dumplings in yelp. Overall food was good - had the beef scallion pancakes and dan dan sizchuan noodles- but nothing amazing imo.
3 Brought my wife to The Bao so she could try the XLB (soup dumplings) and they are no longer on the menu!   Asked the waiter what gives (surely a place named The Bao and with dozens of raving reviews for their XLB on yelp would have them on the menu) and he told us they took them off the menu last week.   Sorry, I came here to get XLB - went elsewhere nearby to get them.
1 They don't have soup dumplings anymore so if that's what you want don't waist your time.
1 I used to love this place, but last night, after waiting for 45 minutes I found out they got rid of their Xiao Long Bao!  Apparently this happened 8/4.   The rest of the menu is OK, but I used to visit for The Bao (hence the name...). Now it's just an average Chinese restaurant.  I had a few of the dumplings and they're not bad, but nothing worth revisiting for.  Really hoping management reconsiders bringing XLB back!
1 I haven't been here for a couple of weeks. But this time is really a big disappointment. I used to come almost every week for Xiaolongbao and other dishes, such as the spicy pot. What a surprise that THEY DON'T HAVE XIAOLONGBAO ANYMORE, particularly they still keep the name! The taste also has changed.
3 A friend was new in town, so we decided to do a small food tour, and what better place than St. Marks? Apparently though, if you're going to do that, The Bao may not be the best place. We were just going to get 3 baskets of XLB for four, but they have a $10/person rule (max 2 CC per table, min $10 per CC). So in addition to the regular XLB, crab XLB, and Super Spicy XLB, we got some Shanghai Noodles.  We didn't want the noodles, so it may be biased, but they were confusing. ARE they supposed to be stir-fried udon noodles? Sparse meat and veggies? Otherwise it was fine, we ate it.  The regular XLB is fine. I hate it when there's stuff/grease floating in the XLB, you know what I mean? I'll go to Joe's for that, thanks. (If you can't tell, Joe's is a major let down for me. I don't know why people go on about that place). Crab is crab, I never like Crab XLB as much as I think I'd do.  The Super Spicy XLB was the best thing we got, especially because (I think) they are unique to this place. But otherwise...just another Chinese place in NYC that doesn't quite hit the spot for me.
3 The soup dumplings are average when compared with other soup dumplings in NYC. The beef noodle soup was good. It was good price for decent food, happy overall.
4 Good XLB. I like the sort of cloth thing they come on in the steamer. It makes it much easier to pluck your dumpling out of the basket without breaking the skin and losing all that delicious soup.
4 I really enjoyed my lunch at the Bao. We ordered the soup dumplings (xiao long bao) and the braised beef with noodle soup. The soup dumplings were very good. The skin of the dumpling was thin and the soup was flavorful. The braised beef noodle soup was decent. The broth was very flavorful although I think they put a bit too much pepper in the broth. I was happy to see generous portions of beef in the soup. The beef was the type of cut where there is some cartilage in the meat. I like that type of beef fine but it's not everyone's cup of tea. I would like to come back to the Bao and try out their other dishes as they have a big menu.
4 Came in with 2 friends. Ordered: -Salt n pepper shrimp -Chicken w/ broccoli (little bit on the salty side) -Crab soup dumplings -Vegetable + egg fried rice -Fried dumplings  Everything was very good, and I would recommend this place.
3 The food here was great, especially the scallion pancake with beef but I give this restaurant only 3 stars because it is not ideal for dining in. There was no AC (spicy food in summer weather...) and bad cell phone reception. The servers were pretty lousy as well- we had to keep looking for them to ask for things and as they definitely were not checking in throughout the meal. No AC and no water....?
4 Their XLB is like the one in Shanghai and it is definitely the best in the city (no one of). The other food is like taiwan style but they are also pretty tasty.
4 Soup dumplings are well made, thin chewy skin, well seasoned filling and flavorful broth. That being said, a bit overpriced so 4 stars
5 The staff are very friendly and helpful. So many great dishes to try it a more than one time experience.  Scallion pancakes with beef were amazing. Extra Spicy Dim Sum were delicious. Spicy Chicken rice was unbelievable. Sweet and sour ribs were phenomenal.
5 Excellent food. Excellent service. It's as simple as that. But since they won't post this unless I add more words...I will go ahead and say the word excellent one more time.
2 They charged me double, but refused to refund a half. I talked to the manager on the phone and he even lied the reason why I am charged double. He told me that my fiend's card was declined, which is not true. When I told him that's a lie and the waiter didn't even tell us about it, manager said "I didn't mean it" and stated different reason, so I hang up.  Food is good, my friend and I got soup dumpling and spicy eggplant and chocolate soup dumpling. We liked it a lot.   They have this weird $10 minimal per person and 2 soups minimal policy.
4 Amazing pork and crab soup dumplings. I could've eaten the whole thing alone. The scallion pancakes with beef and dan dan noodles were also very good, but the soup dumplings stole the show. The price was not bad either. I think it was roughly $25 for the entire meal. The location is also nice and right above Spot dessert bar
4 3.5 stars, rounding up because I imagine it would be better if we hadn't have had this via delivery. It's opposite day for this review because my favorite dishes here weren't the mains here (pork belly and kung pao chicken). I mean the mains here were good but they weren't "the show"...  That honor would have to go to the dumplings which were some of the best I've had (so juicy)! And the cauliflower which I loved... and the Shanghai noodles, which I guess could be considered a main. I guess... Anywho... so tasty.  The Bao is now in our rotation...
1 Came here on an evening out, and arrived late. Place was mostly empty. We ordered 6 dim sum and appetizers and every single one was the worst we'd ever had. Left most of the food on the table.
2 SO ANNOYING - they need to get their act together. Tonight must be my 20th visit to this place, and it's my go-to all the time for lunch, or to take friends for good soup dumplings in Manhattan (and really good sauteed beans). I had dinner tonight with three friends, and when the bill came, there was a huge issue as three of us put credit cards down, and then: "Oh, we only take two cards, maximum, per table," according to the server. I asked why. She shrugged and said she didn't know. I asked her to find out why. She shrugged again and said it was just the way they did it. I asked again: "Why though? I do really need to know, it's massively inconvenient." No reason, apparently. Just how they do it. A HUGE pain in the arse. Because what you really DON'T want to arrange when your friends are rushing for the train home is a bank transfer the next day and of course all the politeness of "no, no, it's on me..." Bao - if there's a table of four, expect four cards. Table of 10, expect 10 cards. It's 2017. Not acceptable.
5 I don't get to NYC very often, so when I find I good restaurant I probably will never go back. The city is #blessed with amazing food options, so why would you ever repeat? Well, it's restaurants like The Bao that make you question how you live your life.   My bff lives in Brooklyn and recommended (read: demanded) that we have some soup dumplings before I returned home to Austin. She had been to The Bao before so we headed out to St. Marks. I'm glad we went on a weekday, because I hear this place can get packed. We were one of 3 people in the restaurant, so our service was quick and efficient. I don't understand why people complain about wait times without reservations, because a restaurant can't help when it gets popular or when people decide to show up. Rant over.   We had the XLB Dumplings and Shanghai Noodles which we shared. The food was plenty for two people and the dumplings were outstanding. I need to diversify my dumpling knowledge, because I can't say too much, but I can say that these are mouthwatering, flavorful, and not to be feared by picky eaters. Anyone can enjoy these dumplings.   The stand out for me was the noods though. They are the best hand-pulled noodles I had on my visit. Its a great side dish to order along with the dumplings, because it compliments so well.   Next visit I'm braving the heat and getting the spicier dumplings, because I'm and now a dumpling addict.
5 Please come here for XLB! Small table, cramped seating, loud and noisy. But there food worth all that cons!
4 XLB ALL THE WAY!!!! If you're ready for the heat get the super spicy xiao long bao - def comparable to Din Tai Fung.  In terms of unique I would recommend the chocolate XLB which is very reasonable and melts in your mouth.   The portions are decently big for two of us we got the Super spicy XLB, Fried Rice Cakes with Beef and the Chocolate XLB. The Fried Rice Cakes are not that great and super oily - heart attack in the making.  The food is amazing but the service is not that great - they seem pretty bored at work and pissed of.
5 Come here for their xiao long bao (XLB/steamed dumplings)!   Located above Spot Dessert Bar in St. Mark's. We almost missed it because the awning covers their name. Small restaurant, cramped seating, super busy but wait times are short. Dim lighting, wooden furniture, simple but nice decor and ambience. Service was quick.   Ordered Kung Fu XLB (pork), crab XLB, and chocolate XLB. Pork and crab were really group! Super soupy and didn't break apart too easily. Meat was soft and the crab flavor came out. Was skeptical about chocolate in the first place..how do desserts and dumplings mix? But they were surprisingly really good!! Basically like a crepe. It was nutella with a slice of banana inside. There are 4 smaller dumplings and the skin is a bit thicker. They also brought it out a bit later when we were almost done with our meal which was appreciated. Different take on dumplings but would come back for more chocolate ones! Overall, definitely recommend their XLB!!
5 Seems really hard to get a spot here but so worth it. Food is great and reasonably priced. It's one of these great Chinese place like red farm and China Blue. The ambiance is casual, efficiency is key.
3 I came back to this restaurant after 2 years. The service was better than before -- friendly waiters. However, the food wasn't as good as before. The Xiao Long Bao was okay but the Szechuan Chili Fried Chicken was too salty and oily. We ordered water spinach but it was plain aka no taste. Also, we noticed they weren't as crowded as before. Sad because this place used to be one of my favorite places in EV but I guess things changed.
5 Simply put - a convenient Chinese takeout spot in the East Village offering a wide array of selection at a fair price and consistently has good quality. I wouldn't advise this place for eat-in, as it is quite small and gets very crowded.
4 We ordered too much food, but every dish was enjoyable. Their fried rice was not condensed in oil, which is great for health reasons. I strongly suggest the beef and scallions dish.
4 The soup dumplings were good! Dumpling skins were very thin but thick enough to hold all the soup inside. This is definitely one of the best soup dumpling place around NYU.
1 This restaurant sucks. If i could only give u zero star i would.  I went there 2 days ago. And servers are not approachable.  Food is really unacceptable. . Service is not good enough to pay for what they are asking for. they didn't check on us. I think this restaurant needs to improve their managemen.
2 I have been to this place several times. The food was okay, usually its good. The service  used to be much better tho. My waiter was rude  with an attitude. I had to ask to refill my water glass all the time. Not coming back
5 Enough of this non sense that Joe Shanghai is the best soup dumpling in NYC! As far as I know the Bao currently holds the title for best soup dumpling in NYC. I still have several other places to try, but at the moment this place takes the cake. The main dishes are incredible as well. Go for the shredded beef and fried chicken. Oh and you cannot forget to start off with an order of dan dan noodles.
4 Crowded and was a wait, even earlier on a Saturday night- they also really pack the tables in so be prepared to be close to your neighbors! But my dishes were, indeed, good. I had the mushroom soup and my friend had the eggplant and string beans (which were spicy but also good!) I would come back as long as I was okay waiting.
5 Stood outside before 12 on a Sunday and we were the first in line. We were let in exactly at 12 and the tables filled up quick! We ordered 3 different soup dumplings, dan dan noodles, mapo tofu and the scallion pancake with sliced beef. Everything was so delicious! Between 4 of us, we killed everything! The soup dumplings were so flavorful, I think my favorites were the crab and spicy. Mapo tofu was just the right amount of spice. We were happy with everything and I can't wait to go back to try other things on the menu.
4 Too pricy for what they're offering, maybe it's just the neighborhood. The serving size is really small. They're spice ratings are off. Three  is actually not spicy. Great ambiance, but our lights were flickering. Too little rice for the lunch specials
4 I'm not sure why I wouldn't give this place a 5. I might. This is easily become one of my favorite spots. Generally a very busy restaurant, has good turnover so the wait times aren't horrendous. They do a really good job of cramming everyone in so the area is a bit tight when you're sitting down but not terrible. The service is usually on point and you are tended to when you need something. The decor isn't anything special but   Onto the food...   The pork soup dumpling is bomb - the dumpling itself feels a bit thin at times but has a good texture and balance of light, yet substantial. The soup and pork itself is very savory and juicy. Nothing to complain about regarding the soup dumpling. I'd say one order is a must, 10 orders, optional.  My favorite dish from here is the Shanghai Pan fried noodles. It's generally been a bit salty which isn't great bu tthey are seriously the best noodles around. As the name suggests, It's pan fried noodles, udon, and it's seasoned really well. The noodles are always a perfect al dente and the bok choy to couple the noodles really provides the types of flavor and texture you're looking for.   I've tried the Szechuan Chili Fried chicken and unfortunately, I didn't really find anything special about it. It was more chili peppers than anything else, so no much chicken. The chicken was a bit more fried/crunchy than I would've wanted and couldn't really put my finger on the quality of the chicken. Taste wise, it had more traditional chinese seasoning which for me is fine, but it was more salty than spicy. I probably won't be getting this again but you should still try it out.   If you're craving some solid XLB, this is the place to go. Prices are fair, nothing absurd and the quality and consistency of what you order is pretty unbeatable. I'll be coming here all the time.   Cash me ousside, how bao dah.
4 Had the soup dumplings and they were exceptional.  The soup was flavorful and light.  Served steaming hot and delightful.  Also got the lunch steamed fish which was a large portion of fish with a light sauce.  Had read other reviewers about how spicy some of the dishes were and that they were too much so I avoided them.  The table next to ours had a dish that had at least a dozen red chili peppers in it with hot sauce and the guy nearly choked to death but he was still smiling.  So far, the best Chinese food I've had in NY.  Oh, and I'm Chinese.
4 Pretty authentic chinese food with xlb steamed bunssss. It's a little pricey and can be hard to figure out if you don't know the dishes.
4 The soup dumplings are amazing here!  Most of the other dishes were great as well, but the xlb soup dumplings really stand out here. I think these could be the best in the city, possibly even better than Shanghai Asian Manor and some of the other more traditional places.
5 Solid place for xiao long bao and other spicy dishes... Most Chinese restaurants are good at one regional cuisine and not the others, but this place somehow managed to do them all with decent and consistent quality.
1 Server has a bad attitude toward customers. Taste is not nearly as good as other Chinese Restaurants nearby. Overall unhappy experience. Would not recommend here.
2 The restaurant is over priced for its mediocre taste. The servers are rude. Would not come again.
5 The Bao is in my opinion one of the better places to get some legit dim sum and authentic Chinese food in the East Village. I came here starving out of my mind with my trusty eating partner and we proceeded to order wayyyyyy too much food then we were capable of consuming in one meal. still made for amazing leftovers
1 First of all, it should be a common knowledge and perception that the dish 'squashed pepper and eggplant' should be served cold, salty and spicy. The eggplant should be squashed really throughly and the pepper seeds should on the eggplant. However when it comes I was pretty upset and disappointed. It was hot, super hot that my friend and I cannot eat and it's not tasty at all. So when I called the waiters to talk about it, what he said was 'oh it is just as it should be.'  No no no, you must not ever had this dish in an authentic way. And what he further asserted is, "oh it's just we put in this cold container so we have this menu under 'cold dishes' section." I mean, what container is hot.. speechless.. If you commit something wrong, you should admit and apologize. But if you argue unreasonably and try to cover your fault. I have nothing to say. Good luck for your business but I'll never come:)
3 Though the price is on the higher side, Xiao Long Bao tastes pretty good, seems authentic and better then the ones they serve at food court or your average Chinese places. Other food looked decent too. The crowd is hip and up beat. A social place for (mainly) the 20s.
5 We no longer live in the City, but when visiting we make a point to get to The Bao. The soup dumplings are light and  flavorful - the broth that springs from them is savory with a light ginger finish.  Amazing - the closest experience to soup dumplings we have enjoyed in our travels throughout Asia.
4 I've been curious about The Bao for a while, and finally had a chance to try it yesterday. My friend and I came here around 4:45, that awkward time before lunch and dinner. There wasn't a lot of people, but the service was still kind of spotty. The host looked around for like a full 30 seconds for an empty table when over half the restaurant was empty?  We ordered the Kung fu xlb, the crab xlb and the chocolate xlb. We got the Kung fu and crab first, but we did wait longer than I expected to. Maybe bc we were in a rush, maybe bc in Chinatown, they come out super quick? But we were not disappointed. They were piping hot, with super thin skin that still held up well against the delicious meat and soup inside. When we were almost done with the two, the waiter asked if we wanted the chocolate ones now or later. We opted for now bc like I said, we were in a rush. The chocolate ones were smaller than the other ones, but still packed a bunch of flavor. It was a mix of sweet and savory, the chocolate oozing out and chunks of banana against the savory xlb skin. All three dishes were well worth the price, even if it is more expensive than Chinatown!
1 OK not for me! Boy this place is horrendous. There is so much salt in everything. The soup dumplings were good perhaps the one and only high point on the menu. The pancakes with beef were strictly ok. But the shanghai noodles were a disaster. Super oily and extraordinarily low on taste.
5 So, so, so, so, so good!!!!   We were in NY for a week and it made me so sad that we couldn't go here a second time. The wait was about an hour but the service was super fast. Even after we were done with our meal around 10, there was still a wait. Four of us ordered the regular xiao long bao, extra spicy xiao long bao, crab xiao long bao and extra spicy fried rice. My favorite was the crab because the spicy xiao long nap was REALLY spicy. The soup inside the dumplings was full of flavor and they were the best soup dumplings I've had. They didn't smell like the usual one and had so much flavor.   If you're someone that can't handle the heat, stay away from anything spicy on the menu and go for the regular flavors. The spicy fried rice was also packed with flavors but after a little bit, it was too spicy to enjoy.
4 I was waiting in line for ippudo, and explored the area for other restaurants with shorter line. I was told that they can seat two people in half an hour on a Monday night, so I signed up. However, ippudo caught up to us. It wasn't until the next day that I got xlb to go and it just blew my mind. The skin was thin and the soup was flavorful. And that is my to go order (unwillingness to wait). Can you imagine how good it's to dine in? I've also heard the fried pork legs are great, will return to try !
4 The Bao is an awesome place for xiao long bao if you don't wanna trek all the way to Flushing or one of those places with a C rating.   We stopped by this place around 9:30 on Monday night. There was still a wait, omg. We were starving, so everything on the menu looked great.   We started with Dan Dan Noodles and Sliced Pork Belly with Chili Garlic Sauce for appetizers. Dan Dan Noodles were amazing; however, Pork Belly was alright. The garlic sauce is very garlicky, duh!  We then ordered 3 trays of xiao long bao -- Kung Fu, Steamed Crab and Super Spicy. They were all amazing, and, yup, I didn't pop any of them. Yay!  Well, we were still hungry, so we ordered two more dishes which were Scallion Pancake and Roasted Pork Egg Fried Rice. Surprisingly, both items were not greasy at all. Pancake was fluffy. Yum!  Anyway, our server coulda been more attentive. XLB should come with ginger dipping sauce, also we shouldn't have to ask for water when our glasses were empty. On the other hand, the food came out pretty quickly! Will definitely go back again.
5 I've been here with just one other person, and I've been here with a large group (~15). Both times, the service was good and the food was great.   When I came with the big group, we put our names down about an hour ahead of time, and they wouldn't seat us until most of us were there. Of course, they sat us at the communal table in the middle. Service was great, and the food came out quickly. As you can imagine, we ordered a lot. We had several orders of the kung fu & crab XLB, noodles, scallion pancakes, fried rice, etc. You name it, we probably ordered it. We were out of there in about an hour. Impressive, right? We were hungry and basically ate our meal in silence (no time for talking, only eating), but the food did come out quickly. AND our bill was only about $300. Not bad at all!
3 The food is nice. Service is mediocre. No outside drink was allowed and we literally had to finish all our coffee before walking into this restaurant. This is somewhat disappointing.
5 Love this place. The soup dumplings taste fresh and great. The crispy beef is more crispy than beef but it has a great flavor. Worth the wait.
5 Really good Chili Fish!水煮鱼！ Kind of expensive. $5 for Tsingtao. Paid $65 with a chili fish, some wonton, and a 鱼香肉丝 for me and my friend.
3 Solid soup dumplings and decor.   Joined some lovely ladies for St. Marks brunch last weekend here. The crab xiaolongbao is better at Shanghai Cafe, but the pork one at The Bao is a strong contender.   The menu pokes out to be part traditional Chinese and part Asian fusion. The fusion app we got was sweet and sour ribs, they were more sweet dry than sour. Beautifully plated. We also got roast pork fried rice, which was traditional--no frills, no garnishes, just good ole chasuichofan on a plate.  Don't pop the dumplings, learn how to eat them properly, and enjoy.
5 My wife and I came with a friend who had lived in the area for many years. We waited for about 20 minutes after being told it would be 30. Came for the soup dumplings and were not disappointed. Also got the Dan Dan noodles which were fantastic. The vege scallion pancakes were good but I wouldn't order them again. Also tried the eggplant with string beans which were also very tasty. Chocolate dumplings for dessert were also good but not memorable. Server was very courteous and food came fast even though the place was packed. To sum it up, we will be back for the Kung fu XLB and Dan Dan noodles and probably try some other items.
4 XLB on point!  They don't take reservations for small parties, but there isn't much of a wait if you make it before 7pm. We came at 730 and waited 45 minutes for a table for 5 people.   The soup dumplings aka XLBs are ok point! So much soup packed in the little dumpling. The shanghai noodles and green beans were also great, but the dumplings were the star of the show.
2 Been here twice. Food is nice but the waiter feels kind of sneaky. First time they refused to do lunch special at the time they listed. Second time they told me different prices and waiting time before and after I came inside. Third time the waiter broke the glass while cleaning up the table, and the water all fell on my clothes. I was all wet.
5 This place is amazing. Food comes out quickly and it's beyond delicious. The chocolate dumplings are especially unique-- a tasty culture blend. But nothing can beat the very authentic xiaolongbao (dimsum). They also have pea shoots (豆苗), an essential healthy and yummy vegetable with other Chinese dishes.
2 Had the Shanghai Soup Dumplings and the Shanghai Noodles (can't remember the full name), the Soup Dumplings were good, but the noodles were too salty for my taste and was definitely not worth the $12 price tag. The service definitely leaves quite a bit to be desired though. We went on a crowded Saturday night, so i understand that it took a while to get a seat. But when it came time to ordering, we were still deciding, the waiter came over and asked if we were ready. We said not yet, and he replied with a "oh really??" to which we were like "yes???". Moving on from that, the rest of the dinner was fine, until it was time to leave when we were basically told to leave by the waitress as there were people waiting. I mean, I get it that they need to maintain the turnover rate of the tables, but there were people who were there longer than we were just sipping on their drinks who weren't asked to leave (??). And for the price we paid for the food, I don't think it's fair to chase people out immediately after they finish their food. To the management, people go out for dinner to have a nice experience eating and socialising with their friends, not to order, stuff their faces with food, pay and gtfo.
5 Omg the soup dumplings here are the best in the East. Not too thick of a noodle, delicious, and worth placing four orders, at least. Other highlights were the snow pea leaves and pepper chicken. Enjoy!
3 Pretty popular place where you usually have to wait for a table. I ate the kung fu xiao long bao, dan dan noodle and scallion pancake, which were all pretty good in my opinion! Stuff are a little pricey here for Chinese food, but I think it's ok for the setting and quality of food. Service leaves a little to be desired though.
5 Only place I've been to in America capable of serving an authentic and delicate xiao long bao in the Taiwanese style (ala Din Tai Feng, which we don't have on the east coast). Wonderful! All you need is several orders of pork xiao long bao. don't burn yourself. Bite a small hole, drink the soup, blow the steam out and then bathe it in vinegar and eat.
5 We came here for the Xiao Long Bao, and it's as good as anything we ate in Hong Kong and Shanghai.  The Dan Dan noodle is delicious, and the scallion pancakes are crispy and not greasy.  Unlike many Chinese restaurants, they can accommodate food allergies! Just call ahead and talk to them.  Very busy on a Thursday night (45 mins wait), the place is small and dimly lit, with tables pretty close together.  But service was efficient and courteous.  Great place for lunch and dinner.
1 I know this restaurant is very popular in NYC and I also understand the price can be higher than others.  I usually do not like to write bad review in Yelp but I have to say my opinion today.   I ordered one spicy pot from the lunch special menu which requires ordering minimum 5 items. The total price is $21 of my spicy pot without rice. I ordered beef ($5), mushroom ($4), bok choy ($3) , beef tripe ($5)and Lotus Root ($4)  However, the pot is small and there were just 3 slices lotus root in the spicy pot which means I spend $4 to get 3 slices lotus root.  By the way, the spicy pot is too salt to eat.   It is not worth $21.
4 Great place, amazing crispy beef better than Joes Shanghai. Also really enjoyed the Bao (soup dumplings). I would give this place 5 stars but the service is not so great. Waiters forgot about some food, nobody comes up and asks if you need anything.  EDIT: You must try the CHOCOLATE bao it's delicious
4 Soup dumplings.  Scallion Pancake. Freaking delicious.  great menu that I didn't try, but want to go back to based on how good their soup dumplings are.  Lots of posers making subpar, not worth eating, soup dumplings but this place delivers what you want.
4 The beef scallion pancakes are definitely the winner here. Super crispy, fresh, a little chewy, with a good amount of meat. I could totally eat a whole plate of these. But of course, we were here to try to soup dumplings! We ordered the Kung fu xlb and the super spicy xlb. The kung fu xlb tasted like a standard decent xlb. They had a nice fatty soup with the perfect thickness of skin. The super spicy, however, was more of an inhalation of peppers. Not particularly spicy but you'll definitely get a reflex to cough.
5 Best soup dumplings in New York. Thin skin, extra soupy and very flavorful!  The waiter recommended the pig's feet as appetizer which is surprisingly finger licking good!!! The brown sugar rice cake was to die for!  Awesome place with come again
3 3.5*   Soup dumplings and Shanghai pan fried noodles were delicious.  That being said, I wasn't too impressed with The Bao. I came here on a Saturday night, waited about 45 minutes to be seated. It was busy so I understand the wait time. I was sat at a small table that was waaaay too close to the other tables. So close that I practically had to lift the table up and move it so that the person at the table next to me could get up. Food was good but I'd rather go to Flushing, pay less, and have more room to spread out the baskets of xiao long bao.
2 I've been here maybe 10 times. Always get the kung pao chicken, good every time. Tonight, however, the kung pao chicken was extremely salty. I was sharing it with a friend and we maybe ate 40% of it before we had to tap out--we could no longer handle it and all we could taste at that point was salt. My date explained this to the waiter, and I asked the waiter if we could order a different dish instead. He was very rude about it and acted as if we were trying to run a scam. The  waiter agreed to bring us a noodle dish instead, and he removed the kung pao plate from our table.  5 minutes later he came back to our table and placed the same kung pao plate back onto our table and then brought over the noodle dish (which was fine). I asked him to take away the kung pao dish and he did so without a word.   When we received the check, lo and behold we were charged for the kung pao chicken.  I can appreciate that if you have a customer who eats a lot of a dish before complaining about it that maybe it's not fair to expect the restaurant to take back the dish for a new one. But if you're going to charge me for the dish anyway, don't be an s.o.b. about me ordering another dish. WHAT IS WRONG WITH THIS GUY??  I give 2 stars and not 1 because I've had good luck with the food until recently. TERRIBLE SERVICE.
4 So whenever I visit my friend in NYC, he takes me on food tours (last time it was desserts starting with Levain Bakery #basic). So this weekend, it's dumpling time.   Service & atmosphere: we came at like 10:30 pm so it was very dimly lit, but not in a bad way. It was packed, but our server and the staff were very quick and attentive.   Food: we were starving because I take forever to get anywhere and so we ordered the crab soup dumplings, pork soup dumplings, scallion pancakes, Dan Dan noodles, and spicy wontons. The soup dumplings were good and had LOTS of soup, but weren't necessarily the best I've ever had. The scallion pancakes were delicious, crisp, but still doughy. The dan dan noodles were good, though again not the best I've had. The spicy wontons were not that spicy at all, but the sauce was so good I may have eaten it with a spoon (#onlygodcanjudgeme).   Perfect place to start an NYC dumpling tour, but I'm excited to explore other places.
4 We had a really nice lunch here while I was taking my cousin sightseeing.  The service was good, it was right on St. Mark's place, and they had a decent menu.  It was a good low-key meal where she could try some different things.  The soup dumplings were good, we got one plain and one spicy.  The spicy is hot, but it was't inedible, just left a nice burn.  We also got vegetable dumplings which were fine, and red bean dim sum.
1 We stumbled upon this restaurant yesterday, Saturday, afternoon on our walk to a comedy club nearby. My partner and I weren't really hungry but decided we needed to eat something before the show at 7. We were seated right away at the shared table. The place has a nice ambience, albeit a bit dark and loud.   We ordered the Kung Fu soup dumplings and the Steamed crab dumplings. The lady then asked us if we wanted to order something else and we said no. She then proceeded to point to the tiny footprint in the menu and said that there is a minimum of $10 per person and that we needed to order more. I told her that we didn't want anything else. She then said  "I will allow it this time but for next time, you will have to order more and don't say we didn't tell you."    I was shocked with the rude attitude so we told her we don't have a problem walking out of the restaurant. And last time I checked, there are other 8,000 (give or take) restaurants in NYC that will want our business. She repeated that this time was okay but not for next time with the same rude attitude. We decided to stay and suck it up because it was 6 and we had to leave in half hour to our show.   The only positive was that the soup dumplings were really good! I preferred the kung fu dumplings over the steamed crab ones.   So thank you so much, The Bao, for ALLOWING us  to eat at your restaurant while squeezed in with other diners at the communal table of yours, even though we were short of the $2 dollars order from your minimum requirement!   We promise you that we will come back. NEVER.
4 The soup dumplings were fantastic but eat them immediately because if they sit to long they burst when you pick them up. Eggplant with green beans was delicious even my niece tried it and liked it. The wine choices were very limited. My niece loved the orange chicken.
3 Not super impressed.   Our waiter was very so-so. He did not smile and acted like he was annoyed to fill our empty water glasses.  The prices were a tad bit higher for the same Chinese food I can find in flushing or chinatown. The Beef soup was very good though! Came is a big mug and was perfect for a chilly day. But you had to order two orders which is kind of wrong...  The portions for lunch were a bit small but I guess $9 wasn't terrible.
4 Very good dumplings! Love the spicy wontons and string beans too!
4 The menu is just the right kind of homey, comfort food that you want from a Chinese restaurant. The flavors are true to their roots and it brings you back to my family's kitchen. The soup dumplings here are delicious and just right. The skin is thick enough to hold in the porky, gingery broth. You will want to slurp up every bit of the broth. The scallion pancakes are crisp but tender. I just wished it was pan-fried instead of deep fried. The braised pork belly is a little pot of heaven. The layers of fat and meat will make your inner carnivore ecstatic. The sauce leans towards the sweeter side but its still delicious and don't over look the mushrooms in the dish. They are like flavor bombs that have soaked up all that sauce. Service is attentive and friendly. Prices are definitely not Chinatown prices but it's the East Village. It's definitely a go to.
3 Soup dumplings are the bomb, however I wish they had more of a selection. Scallion pancakes are also so delicious. Great spot, however I feel like you can find similar quality soup dumplings in Chinatown for much cheaper.
4 Came here with a party of 5 to BYOB and go hard on xiao long bao. They wouldn't let me reserve since it was a weekend, so told everyone to show up at 6:45 and hope for the best. One of my friends got stuck halfway into the city and was running half an hour late (as per usual)-- initially told us they wouldn't seat us without our full party but they changed their minds a few minutes later. Score.  They charge for BYOB! Think it was $5 per wine bottle and $3 per beer. Luckily I had a 32-ounce of Sapporo, so enough to share with friends without getting ripped off. They would only bring one cup (?) so everyone chugged their waters / shared. Par for the course on NYC BYOB so didn't take it personally.  Two friends got classic xiao long bao and shared with the table-- I'm not a soup dumpling expert but they were quite good. My dan dan noodles were great, with perfect texture and right amount of chili oil. My late friend's eggplant was unexpectedly wonderful, super smoky and flavorful.  Prices are pretty inflated, but we made it out of there with $80 (including tax and tip) for all five of us. This is on St Marks and gets packed at peak hours, so plan accordingly. Service was rushed and clearly understaffed. Atmosphere is NYU-ish and lively, a bit loud but good vibes. Ended up being really fun for a group catch up / pregame.
4 Haven't tried anything else here but the Kung Fu Xiao Long Baos are AMAZING. Better than Joe's! Knocked one star because of their slow service. The waitress came over nearly 20 minutes after being seated, asked us what we wanted, and as I proceeded to tell her she told me to wait so that she could get her tablet ready.... Still coming back though!
3 Came here yesterday for a late lunch with a girl friend. The food was very good! We shared the soup dumplings, hot pot with some random items and the beef scallion pancake which is MUST TRY DISH. I loved it. Wish I had the stomach to try more of their food.   To be honest - Our waitress wasn't that great which is why I gave 3 stars. I believe service is everything and places with such great media and reviews like this should have great service too!   Otherwise, I highly recommend this place for their food, especially the scallion pancake with beef!
4 The Kung fu Xiao Long Bao is so delicious, almost forgot how expensive it was though. We also ordered the scallion pancake with beef, also very delicious. Came here for a quick bite so that's the only things we ordered. The dough for the Xiao Long Bao was acceptably thin but still holding all that delicious soup inside. The beef scallion pancake was pretty flavorful but expensive as well. The scallion pancake wasn't greasy. It also had a bit of sweetness to it, I'm guessing they used hoisin sauce with it.   Food was delicious. Atmosphere was nice, not too noisy. Dim lighting during the day. Service was just okay. Four stars mainly because the food was great. I'd come back to try different dishes.
4 I selfishly want to keep this place to myself, but it is Lent and I am trying to be good. Amazing xiao long bao, oh and the spicy tofu (I never knew I would "love" tofu) and the spicy eggplant (yum). Service here is great, be prepared to wait for a table on a busy night (which is probably every night) and totally worth it. Seriously, try this place for the best xiao long bao (if you don't know what that is I've got that going for me).
4 with the winter we are having soup dumplings have been a big hit with us recently. and the bao serves up some excellent xiao long bao!!   i'll give it **** because of the bao alone. we enjoy the kung fun (pork) and wasabi (also pork).   we've also tried the regular dumplings and the crispy beef but neither were nearly as good. and I found the beef ridiculously overpriced at almost $20 for a very small portion so I wouldn't order that again and am skeptical about their other entrees based on that.   the service here is also debatable. first trip it was efficient and friendly. second trip it was messy (spilled sauce all over the table and didn't clean it up), inattentive (empty water glasses multiple times through the meal and no spoons or plates for our last dumplings), and forgetful (we asked for our bill then he proceeded to clean 3 tables and reset them in the back before we had to request it a second time).   so come here for the xiao long bao but don't expect much else!
4 Come here for: warm casual cuisine at communal tables   Food: very good! We had the scallion pancake (a bit heavy, could have been thinner), the wontons, the xiao long bao, and sizzling beef. Food was very fresh, I wouldn't call it healthy because it was a lot of friend food but it wasn't dripping in oil (these people know how to fry!)  Service: good, bustling and busy  Decor: communal tables are fun, easy to snoop on what others are eating which is always a treat
4 Delicious xiao long bao-- dare I say better than Din Tai Feng; the noodles, however, not so much. The xlb was served extremely hot with a delicious, savory broth that spilled out once the skin-- perfectly cooked, not too fragile and not too thick-- was broken. I inhaled three of these and could easily have eaten another six probably. The spicy noodles in hot chili oil and slices of beef shank (I forget the name) was lackluster, lacking in flavor and overly compensating for that with too much chili oil.   Tip: There's a 20$ minimum charge here, so I would highly recommend getting 3 orders of xlb instead of a noodle dish. The xlb are that good.
4 Great spot for lunch or a weeknight dinner, here is a very long wait here on the weekends. The scallion pancakes here are the best I've ever had, warm and flaky. The xlb are great, but don't stand out as being better than places in Chinatown though I do appreciate that the wrappers are just the right thickness, delicate but sturdy. The braised pork belly with buns was tasty, we will definitely try another main next time as they all looked delicious.
3 The food was good, which is why I still gave it three stars.  But I when I bite into my sautéed pea pod, I found pieces of plastics in my mouth...unbelievable and not ok. The delivery man was rude and demanded for tips when he called me (I had tips ready before he called)!!
4 When you have a mighty hankering for XLB, NYC offers some of the best. I'd hear that The Bao ranked highly, so my wife and I decided to give it a try.  First impression was that the place was packed; between people waiting for a table and folks picking up to go orders, the tiny space between the desk and the door was shoulder to shoulder. Fortunately we only had to wait around ten minutes as it was just the two of us, and we were seated by the front window.  For drinks, I stuck with water, but my wife ordered the lemonade. I tried it, it was tasty, it had limes floating in it. Neat touch, but we all know it's not why we're here. Since we were pretty much starving, we ordered some dan dan noodles to kick things off, then 2 orders of kung fu XLB (pork) and 1 order of steamed crab. The noodles were pretty tasty, but honestly very mild (and coming from me, that's saying something.) We mixed em up, we dug deep in the oil, but something was just missing without that heat. That said, the noodles were cooked beautifully, the texture was perfectly chewy.  On to the main event! The skin of the dumplings was thin, which was great - as ever, I kept tearing holes in mine trying to pick them up, but my wife didn't break a sweat, let alone a dumpling. The crab meat was very good and fresh-tasting, and while the soup was pretty good, it didn't rise above the really fantastic pork. The Kung Fu XLB was the clear winner, with delicious soup and tasty pork that, true to rumor, ranks with the best in the city.   Throughout the meal service was prompt and polite, so high marks. They were on top of things, but we never felt rushed despite the rapid pace. The space was clean, and while the ambiance was what I'd politely describe as "lively", no one comes here for the atmosphere. We're all here for the bao.
3 Ive been here two times before for lunch hours, but this was my first time coming for dinner. I wouldve given it a 4 stars for my previous experiences with the food. I don't know if it was because they were super busy, but the quality of the food downgraded. The meat inside the kungfu soup dumpling was soggy and not cooked well. The scallion meat plate was pretty salty. Must order rice to balance the saltiness of the meat. We also ordered scallion pancakes and they did not look how they looked like in the past not did they appear like in the pictures the people posted. They also never gave us the dipping sauce for the pancake. I was super excited to share this place with my friends, but they came out pretty disappointed.
3 Dine in Chinese restaurant that seems to serve foods on the slightly higher quality than the restaurants in China town. But the taste doesnt seem to reflect that to be honest.  Food (3.5/5) Price (3/5 in reflection of food taste and amount) Compared to Shanghai cafe, their soup dumplings were not that impressive actually. And for 6 pieces they were charging $2.50 more almost. And they served 2 pieces less than shanghai which sells 8 pieces for almost $5. Their serving is more restaurant like than the ones in china town but it wasnt superb either.  We also ordered one of their noodles which i have a pic of but dont recall the name. That one was actually a lot more bland than Ive anticipated it to be.  Ill be open for future try again but as of now its whatever.  Ambiance (3/5) I came here twice, once with a friend and the other time with my girlfriend. For some reason they really like to dim the atmosphere and I kind of had a hard time seeing my gf's face (like eating in the dark).  Just like a lot of places in NY, you ll be seated literally a hand away length from other people.
4 How bao it.   The wait here was craje long and the space is very cramped, but the food was really hao; the xiao long bao was especially good. We ordered the shrimp and beef, and a vegetable beef dish with rice. I'd definitely recommend going early and ordering the soup dumplings.
5 YUMMMMMMMMMM. The food here is dope and it is BYOB. My sister brought me here and we got A LOT of food including the XLB dumplings, beef noodles, mapo tofu, bok choy, and the orange chicken.   We ended up having to take food home, but it was so delicious. It was definitely busy around lunch time on a weekday when we went, but our wait wasn't too bad since they do turnover the tables fairly quickly. The food also came out quickly which was very nice and the staff was friendly.  Definitely some great eats at this place. I highly recommend it!
5 The Bao is aptly named as it has the most amazing soup dumplings ("Kung Fu Steamed Pork Buns") with the thinnest dough, but it's not a one-trick pony. Other standouts include Rice Cake with Beef (this was temporarily removed from the menu; so glad it's back!); Boiled Fish in Chili Oil; Mapo Tofu; and Sauteed String Beans. If you come by for lunch, there's a special lunch menu in additon to the full regular menu (with its regular prices) at that hour.
2 Kung fu xiao long bao: 4/5 Steamed crab xiao long bao: 3/5 Scallion pancakes with beef: 4/5 Dan dan noodle: 1/5 Service: 1/5  I usually write my reviews with a heavy focus on the food itself rather than service or ambience of the resto. If the food is bomb, then the service or vibe isn't a deal breaker for me 99.9% of the time. Unfortunately with this place, we couldn't actually enjoy our food due to the rude waiter who kept pushing us to order more or leave. I've never felt so rushed/unwanted in a restaurant before and it really made our lunch a bad experience overall.   Moving on with the food- the xiao long baos were pretty good but I believe they're filled with MSG, as the next day my lips were severely cracked lol and this happens when I have a lot of MSG. Also, $10 for 6 pieces of xiao long bao is SO overpriced! Scallion pancakes were actually great but it was too sweet for my friends. Dan dan noodle was really disappointing as it was just chili oil covered noodles topped with over cooked ground beef. Worst dan dan noodle I've had.   I don't think I'll come back here ever again just bc of how we were treated. Too bad as this place had such good reviews...
5 The Bao -52 13 St marks place Best ambiance and the dumplings were very good, good enough that you don't have to go to Chinatown and wait in line.  Drinks: - Tsing Tao.  Dumps: - pan fried pork dumpling- truly excellent. Were lightly fried so you could really taste the inside flavors. Not too oily.   - kung fu - very good plai soup dumpling.  - super spicy - so dope. Pork soup dumpling with really good flavor with good heat. Not too spicy- just the right amount.  - crab - was everyone's least favorite   - wasabi - Excellent pork soup dumpling with bits of wasabi inside. Made for great broth. Do not recommend eating these without slurping the broth and taking it down in bites or the wasabi could be overwhelming.   - chocolate banana dump- very good dessert dumpling. It was a soup dumpling with banana and nutella inside.
4 The Xiao Long Bao alone is enough to make a trip to The Bao worth it. The Kung Fu Xiao Long Bao and the Extra Spicy Xiao Long Bao are delicious, and I would recommend both. Aside from these two dishes, we also got the peashoots, scallion pancakes with beef, dan dan noodles, and vegetable fried rice.   The only suspicious thing about this restaurant is that the food comes out ridiculously fast, and you know it's been prepared a while ago. During today's meal, the peashoots came out within one minute of us putting in the order, and they were cold.   If you want to get a table without a wait, I would recommend going before 5:30pm.
5 Good food! I enjoyed the crab soup dumplings!! Also the jasmine tea fried rice was delicious!
3 Came to The Bao after seeing it again and again on various "Best Soup Dumplings in NYC" lists. The wait wasn't bad despite many people waiting outside. For a party of 2 the hostess guessed we'd be waiting 25 minutes but it was much less.  Since it was our first time here, we ordered some of the most popular items: Scallion Pancakes, their classic Soup Dumplings, their Super Spicy Soup Dumplings, Dan Dan Noodles and Sichuan Chili Chicken. The scallion pancakes were some of the best I've had in a while - flakey, and slightly crispy without being overly oily - and still chewy in the middle. The Dan Dan noodles were tasty, and not overly seasoned. Plus, with the spinach it meant we at least technically had something green on the table. My first bite of chicken was absolutely delicious and I could immediately see why people ordered it all the time. However, after about 3 bites I noticed the chicken was giving my mouth a very strange aftertaste and feeling... I LOVE spicy food, so that was not the issue, but I just couldn't shake the weird sensation left on my tongue from the chicken.   Finally, the soup dumplings. I can see why these are ranked highly, the broth is flavorful without being too salty, and the meat tastes high quality. I do have to say that even with being very careful, I broke about half of my dumplings before getting them into my mouth given how thin the skin was, which always makes me feel a bit like I "failed" the meal. The super spicy dumplings packed some major heat and had a unique flavor unlike other dumplings I've tried. I'd definitely come back for those!  Overall, I think The Bao is worth checking out, especially if you don't feel like heading into Chinatown to fulfill your dim sum cravings. The interior is modern and trendy, and the service - while speedy - was far more polite than some of the traditional spots I've been to. That being said, I think the prices are a bit higher than justified given you can get similarly delicious dim sum for much less if you're willing to sacrifice the clean aesthetic and friendly waitstaff.
4 Third time here with friends. The more I have their bao (their namesake), the less impressed I am with them for the price. There are a ton of places that serve quality baos and dumplings in the LES and Chinatown with more portion for less cost. Service and atmosphere are nice
5 The food here is delicious. I came here with 3 other friends and we literally ordered everything on the menu. I can't think of a single thing that wasn't delicious. I was quite impressed by how tasty the vegetarian options were. Heaven!
5 The bao is the bomb. We had 11 people fit into the biggest table they offered. Unfortunately it wasn't round and it didn't have a lazy susan. As a result, we split the group up into two different sub-groups to order, and as a table we shared multiple servings of Xiaolong Baos. Mmmmm amazing.  Aside from that we got some eggplant, some tofu, a chili fish (which was amazingggg - not super heavy but very tender and amazing fish). One person in our group was feeling a little sick so he didn't get any of the family style food with us and instead opted for the mala pot.   You really have to appreciate the comedy of the following situation. As I'm working through all the amazing foods hoisted out upon the table, my friend eating the mala pot had slowed down his velocity of consumption. I look over and he says: "man, I think I need to stop - I might be allergic to something in this." I thought about it - yeah you never know - he might be right and asked him why he thought that. After a few seconds of discussion it became clear that the only symptom he was showing was that his tongue was numb. At this point I turned towards my other friend (who was Chinese) and we began a big cackle!   "It's MALA homes!" "This ain't no regular spice, this is NUMB SPICE! And you got a whole pot of it!"  End of the day I'm not sure he was convinced, or that he had a great time. And I learned a valuable lesson which is while I think of Mala and La both as just 'spicey' they're actually quite different sensations upon the tongue.  I apologized for not warning him beforehand, but also believed it was a meaningful lesson in the cuisines of China. I hope he'll still come back!
4 We decided to go to The Bao because the wait for TimHoWan was too long.  My girlfriend and I had 2 orders of Kung Fu Xiao Long Bao, 1 order of Shanghai Pan Fried Noodles, and 1 order of Scallion Pancakes with Beef inside.  Xiao Long Bao: My girlfriend and I eat it differently, I like to put vinegar in mine while she doesn't. In addition, we both suck the soup first and then eat the rest of it. Tbh, I've had better Xiao Long Baos, the meat inside wasn't the best so I give these a 3/5.  Noodles: My girlfriend and I split the noodles. There was a good amount of beef and shanghainese bokchoy. The noodles themselves were pretty delicious. A lot of oil (but that goes for almost all Chinese foods). My only complaint is that I'm not a big vegetable person so minus 0.5 = 4.5/5  Pancakes: These are absolutely the best pancakes I have ever had. Originally, my girlfriend wanted to get the regular scallion pancakes. However, I believed that the protein from the meat would make the pancakes even better. I was right (of course). HOLY SHIT, the sauce (I think it was oyster sauce, or the same sauce they serve with Beijing Duck) was PHENOMENAL. The way the pancake's crunchiness and the beef's chewiness and the sauce's flavor all meshed perfectly creating the 6/5 pancake.  According to the math, that's 4.5/5. However, since this place is called The Bao, I had higher expectations for the Xiao Long Bao. Although in the menu, they do have all sorts of weird Baos that I want to try in the future. Will come back!
4 I've walked past The Bao so many times when I've been around St Mark's, but it always seems to be packed. I wasn't sure what to expect, but was definitely pleasantly surprised when I finally decided to put my name down for a table this past Saturday. My boyfriend and I stepped away to grab a coffee and got back just in time to be seated. The xiao long bao here is probably the best we've had in the city - the skin is thin and the soup is incredibly fresh. We definitely went overboard with ordering mapo tofu, eggplant and string beans, and pork belly buns as well, but it was worth getting to try a variety of dishes. Everything was so, so good! Would return with a larger party to try even more, although it might be a wait.
5 Really great food!  I went here for a late lunch and was blown away by the quality of the Chinese food.  The bok choy alone is superb, but other things - the Singapore noodles, the soup dumplings (a must-have), and the hedgehog dumplings - were equally excellent.    This place has a reputation for being a bit rushed, but I didn't have the same experience and enjoyed it immensely.
3 I will start by saying me and my friend only ordered some xiao long bao, a beer, and their champagne milk tea. We were happy we were allowed to be seated 40 minutes before closing, which was perfect considering we only had an hour to eat before we had to head to the club. The atmosphere was cozy, but that's where the coziness ends. It was hard getting the servers attention after placing part of our order, so we ended up just ordering drinks rather than a meal. The dumplings were yummy but not the best I've had. Don't know if I'll be back for the dumplings, but if you name a place after what you want to be known for, is it worth coming back to try anything non-bao? Maybe I'll give it another try sometime earlier than 10pm
4 We gratefully stumbled upon The Bao to grab something to eat before going downstairs into the Spot Dessert Bar for some after dinner treats. The Bao is quaint, cozy and comfortable.   I enjoyed the view as we were seated at a table near the window overlooking other shops located near this eatery. This establishment has their lights turned low so that the candles placed upon the tables beautifully glowed which created such a nice atmosphere.  ordered some Pan Fried Dumplings as an appetizer and also had a shared plate of Chicken Fried Rice. The Chicken Fried Rice and Pan Fried Dumplings were flavorful and tasted fresh. The Bao's homemade lemonade comes in a cute mason-like jar and it was delicious!   I will return to try other dishes at this restaurant as well as to enjoy their playlist which included some of the best jazz music I have ever heard at an establishment!
5 My friend took me here yesterday. As a Chinese who loves spicy food, I do think the dishes here are authentic. We ordered the famous crab xiaolongbao, not to much crab but pretty good taste. The spicy wok is amazing, you get to pick your own stuff and level of spicy. We ordered beef/tripes/spam/wings/potato in the wok with spicy, it is even better than the one I had in China! Braised pork knuckles are also great!
1 Soup dumplings are excellent.  I would go back and only order those.  Everything else is super heavy on the MSG.  That's a no for me.
5 Heard great things about the soup dumplings so we decided to go there for lunch. We were not disappointed. The service was great. The waiter explained how one eats a soup dumpling after watching me struggle with my chopsticks and spoon. Once I was prepped, the rest was pure enjoyment. I would definitely go back next time we are in New York.
3 Min $10 per person  When it's busy they will keep pushing the check in your face which is really annoying   Food is not bad  Probably cheaper/better soup dumplings in Chinatown
4 Consistently serving great food, the Bao also makes for a perfect quick date spot. They'll seat you ASAP and the service is very attentive so you can get in and out in under an hour. The Shanghai pan fried noodles, Dan Dan noodles, General Tso's chicken, and of course the dumplings, both soup and pan fried, are all delicious. My only complaint would be the overcrowded tables and communal seating, but a nice atmosphere overall.
1 Ordered through yelp, they ran out of water spinach and gave us something else. The right thing to do would be to call us about it not just replace it. Also gave us some noodles without soup saying they changed that too. Last time i eat here.....thanks for the service
4 I've been to this place multiple times and it has never disappointed me. The soup dumplings here are so velvety and just the perfect size. They really got them down to a science. Other good dishes include the rice cakes with pork, the beef with scallions and the lo mein. The chili fried chicken is ok. More of an appetizer than a main...anyway if you want really good soup dumplings just come here and forget the other places.
5 Had our first soup dumplings. What a treat. Everything was great from the service to the food. Can't wait to go back.
4 Went to this cute spot in the East Village on a Sunday evening. The house was packed but a fairly short wait. Service was excellent and food was good. Save room for dessert at The Spot downstairs!
4 Located in the Chelsea Market in NY, this is the place to go for hand pull noodles. Just have to be patient with the wait in line and watch your noodle make in front of your eye. If you like spicy try the dan dan dry noodle or go for the thin slide hand pull with beef broth. This is one of the best hand pull noodle I have found so far.  Do not forget to order they side order pickles. Table space are limited so you just have to make use of whatever open area you can find.
5 I agree with the name! You can literally see them pull the noodles in the back of the kitchen before cooking it. Both times I've been, I got the spicy Taiwanese beef noodles... so delicious!   The portion is pretty generous - more than I can finish in one sitting, and really not a bad deal for the price. They do put on enough toppings so it's not simply a heap of noodles. The beef brisket is very tender and flavorful. The broth is a bit on the salty side, but also very flavorful.   There isn't a lot of seating, but I haven't been stranded, standing, with a hot bowl of noodles yet. People can get a bit... Darwinian... with the seats, but that's not the staff's fault. Service is friendly and you can get a lid for and bag from the counter if you don't finish your food.   This is definitely one of my go-to places in Chelsea Market.
4 This place really lives up to it's name because the noodles are definitely the freshest that you will ever encounter.  In fact you could see them hand pull the noodles and cook them just prior to being served.  The noodles were just the right firmness and were really delicious.  The beef portions were generous. The seasonings were flavorful and spicy however it was much too salty for me taste.
5 These noodles are great! Quick and efficient service, a few options. I had the beef noodle soup. Noodles were chewy, beef was tender and soup was savory!
1 We went on a Saturday and wasn't in line long at all. Showed up around noon. I ordered the vegan noodles and a friend ordered the beef noodles. The noodles were decent but the broth was yuck - so much oil - not sure why anyone would drink that. We didn't even finish half of our bowl and threw it out. We felt like we were drinking a gallon of oil. Place is overrated. Don't believe the hype! Go elsewhere for better soup noodles with less oil.
5 After looking for a delicious noodle place on my trip to New York, this is the place I decided to visit. It's located in Chelsea market so very trendy!   I came on a Wednesday afternoon so I didn't encounter the line that I read a lot about. I knew what I wanted to order so it took about 5 minutes to make it to the register and place my order. The staff was friendly and helpful! I enjoyed speaking with them!   I ordered the Taiwanese beef noodle soup VERY spicy and a bottle of water which cost me around $12 (one of my cheaper meals in New York)   The soup was DELICIOUS! The broth was perfectly seasoned and filled with bok choy, several beef chunks, and other spices/herbs. The noodle were cooked perfectly and delicious as well. The spice was not spicy at all. If you're used to spice this is for you! If not they offer a regular noodle soup.   I will definitely be making my way back here on my next trip to New York!
5 My mouth is literally watering thinking about the cumin beef noodles. Recently moved to NYC and you guys definitely know how to make delicious noodles.  Located in Chelsea Market, the line can be long, but moves fast. Try to snag yourself a seat by the bar (and grab a beer behind you while you're at it) where you can watch them pull your noodles right before it goes into the water bath and straight into your bowl. The chewy texture of the noodles along with the pungent cumin broth is amazing. My BF had the spicy dan dan noodles which were also amazing. I seriously wish I could eat noodles every day of my life.   I will continue to search for delicious noodles in New York but this is my favorite thus far.
5 The dan dan noodles here were sooo good!!  The noodles were perfectly made and so so flavorful Incredibly spicy though.. my tongue was pretty numb halfway through The fried fava beans on top were perf -- they added a great crunch  It's really hard to find somewhere to sit though I ended up sitting on the side And I could see them pulling the noodles and preparing the food through the glass!  Can't wait to come back
5 AMAZING SPICY CHEWY SPICY CUMIN-EY lamb hand pulled noodles. I really enjoyed this and will quite likely find an excuse to return, at the expense of my arteries (did I mention the chilli-laden oil?). Superb.
5 Amazing food, right by an entrance to Chelsea Market so you can be in and out if that's your plan. Get the dry cumin lamb noodles. The noodles are obviously very fresh, made right in front of you. The lamb is tender and is very well seasoned, combined with the flavorful and aromatic chili oil makes for a perfect combination of mouth feel and flavors. The oil sits at the bottom so definitely mix the noodles up before you eat!
4 This beautiful gem is located in the Chelsea market in nyc. If you want my advice... run to this place to beat the tourists on line then go see everything else after! This will also guarantee a seat for you.  The aroma of the broths and noodles will definitely have you salivating while you wait on line. There are only a few cooks and it's great to see them put on a show and assemble your meal.   They have a small menu and being vegan made it smaller for me... but that doesn't matter!   The vegan spicy dan dan doesn't play around with the heat. These noodles are creamy, nutty, and with every piece you eat the level of heat intensifies! Every bite will definitely be followed with an "mmmmm" and want you kissing the hands of those that made your meal lol  My girlfriend had the vegan mock duck which was also bomb! The noodles were soft and pillowy like. The mushrooms and cilantro added a fresh component that complimented the dish so well.   We then split the cucumbers, and these little jewels are crunchy, spicy, and sweet, talk about a triple threat! I recommend cooling off your taste buds with the the red bean soy milk! Sweet and satisfying :)  No matter how long the line is I am waiting for the noodles. With a name like "Very Fresh Noodles" you would have to think they better come to play... and it's a home run every time ! Lol   #alecertified
2 On my visit to Chelsea Market, I had gotten dinner from a different place.   After finishing my food, I was still pretty hungry.  Luckily for me, I was with another vegan who had ordered the Vegan Noodles with Mock Duck from Very Fresh Noodles.  My vegan friend couldn't finish their noodles.  So, I rolled up on that!  It was a pretty solid dish.  By the time I got my share of the noodles, the dish had cooled down considerably.  I found the noodles to be a bit clunky, and the noodles tended to glob together.  The dish was also pretty greasy, and there was an interested gritty texture I couldn't figure out if I liked. The flavors were solid.  It was spicy, but not over the top.  The wait for service at this place seems out of proportion with the quality of the food.  There were other restaurants near by that I thought were much better quality with much less of a wait.  I would probably not return to this place, unless someone else was buying me the meal.
4 Delicious and spicy hand-pulled noodles. I got the cumin lamb (dry). It wasn't so much dry as it was oily. However, it was very flavorful and spicy and the noodles were chewy. My friend got the beef noodle soup. It was flavorful too (in a different way, since I think the tomato in the broth makes it slightly more tangy). The beef was tender and plentiful. I liked the beef more than the lamb in terms of the meat quantity and quality. For bubble teas, I got the Thai tea and my friend got the black tea. I prefer the Thai tea because it's sweeter and the black tea tasted pretty bland. They also had some vegan options like dan dan noodles (supposedly very spicy) with seitan and vegan hand pulled noodles with mushrooms - wish I could've had room to try them all. Note that seating is very limited - it's in Chelsea Market so you just have to try to grab a table or one of the rare countertop spaces.
5 Amazing noodles, very fresh and thick and delicious. Got the vegan noodles in soup and it was scrumptious and filling, definitely worth the semi-long wait on a weekday evening. It's really cool to see them making the noodles in front of you, too! A very high quality meal -- would definitely recommend.
4 I REALLY like Very Fresh Noodles, but I still prefer Xi'an Famous Noodles. I know, I know.   It's awesome to see that Very Fresh Noodles now has a larger home in Chelsea Market instead of their small corner previously crammed in a tiny space. Very Fresh Noodles is hard to miss, because there is always a ridiculous line (although it moves quickly). Like most Chelsea Market eateries, there's a little bit of counter space for the lucky few who are able to snag a seat, but it's better to mentally prepare yourself to have to eat your food standing up or sitting down on the ground somewhere in Chelsea Market. Speaking from experience, the soup noodles do not travel well as the noodles get soggy.   As far as the food goes, it's really delicious. I prefer the cold cucumbers here vs. Xi'an Famous Noodles a thousand times over. More flavor, bigger portions, cheaper price. I prefer Xi'an Famous Food's noodles though, as I find them chewier. I find the noodles here just a little bit mushy. However, my better half actually prefers the noodles here so it's worth trying. The noodles are ~$2 more than Xi'an's, but the portions are bigger, and I find that there's more meat. The cumin beef dry noodles and Taiwanese beef soup noodles were both super delicious and flavorful, but airing on the side of too salty. Note that "extra spicy" here is actually somewhat spicy to a spice-lover vs. Xi'an's spiciest level (+1 for Very Fresh Noodles). I love that there's a vegan option on the menu. I also love that their Thai Tea isn't that sweet.   TL;DR: The noods are solid. I like it, but not as much as Xi'an Famous Foods. I'll nevertheless be back for more.
5 Solidly good beef noodles ....  hand pulled and you watch them do it and make evening to order.    Great value for the location it's in, and well I wish I was in nyc to get another bowl of this stuff!     Yummy!
5 I came to visit the market recently and I was super surprised to see Very Fresh Noodles expansion. From the tiny hidden jewel in the corner, it now became a bigger venue. It is by far, the best hand-pulled noodle spot in the area!! I left a review before but I had to do it again because it's just so yummy!!! The beef is super tender, almost melts in your mouth, the noodles are literally dumb fresh, never stale, fresh veggies all the time. The staff is absolutely wonderful and super nice. There's a reason why there's always long lines, but it's totally worth the wait. (For all you yelpers that complain about the wait time). You could tell the owner cares about service and QUALITY since he's there all the time helping and making this bomb ass master piece. Victor, you're the best man. Keep up the great work guys!!!
3 Pros: -Conveniently located in Chelsea Market -Beef from taiwanese beef noodle soup is pretty tender and the noodles were fresh  Cons: -Long line -Lack of seating -Super overpriced. I would much rather go to xi'an famous foods for cumin noodles.  -Broth from the beef noodle soup was bland
5 YES YES YES.  I'm not a vegetarian but the mock duck vegan soup is PHENOMENAL. So much umami. This dish is heavy. I get it with broth but you can get it dry. The noodles are enormous, large, flat  and chewy. The broth is so flavorful. The mushroom and mock duck add so much texture you really do not miss meat. There's a really nice underlying lemon grass flavor too. The staff is friendly and the service is quick even at the height of Chelsea Market lunch hour. I will be coming here again and again.
4 Chelsea Market has a lot of great eateries, so deciding on a place to eat wasn't the easiest thing to do. Since I had a craving for noodles, this option seemed great, and damn did it deliver.  The menu looks delicious, but I was only able to try the Very Spicy Dan Dan Mian. The noodles were very thick and seen ever so slightly undercooked, but it gave an interesting consistency to the dish. The minced pork was alright, but the real flavor came out in the spices. I thought it was great, but I can see how it might seem too spicy for others. It was bursting with flavor and the consistency was well complimented by the crunch of the beans and cucumber.  I got the Coffee Milk Bubble Tea which was very refreshing. I hope to be back again.
4 Ordered the Dan Dan Mei spicy noodles with pork and was not disappointed! The half of roll of paper towels I took from the counter went to good use sopping up the spicy goodness from my face as well as blowing my running nose! Good stuff! Washed it down with some cooling and hydrating Coconut Juice. I would love to come back when I'm hankering for some noodle comfort food! Good choice out of all the food stalls here in Chelsea Market. I wanted to sit at the bar and watch the cooks perform their magic but it was already full so I had to find a table over by the Doughnuttery around the corner. All in all a fun and tasty experience!
5 I was resistant towards trying these noodles because of the hype, but I understood once I tried it. These noodles are amazing.  It's difficult to choose something to eat at Chelsea Market because of the variety, but it's definitely worth the stop. I had the cumin beef noodle soup and the broth was great, but it was really the noodles that got me. They were soft on the edges and chewy on the inside-- I was actually pretty full already when I started, but I forgot how full I was when I tasted these noodles! I'm already looking forward to trying these noodles the next time I'm at Chelsea Market!
4 Very fresh noodles lives up to its name! They were being made fresh right in front of me. The line was long but the service was fast. The portion was HUGE. I was hungry and couldn't eat half. The spice was fabulous and the noodles were amazing. I only wish they had half sizes so I didn't feel so wasteful.
1 The Asian female service worker is so so so rude!the bad service doesn't worth 15% tips,she scream to us!
4 The good: amazing texture and meat flavors, and Jackie Chan posters. The bad: a lot of spicy oil can make your tummy murmur, and the noodles will leave you wanting a nap. But Even after feeling bloated I want more of these noodles the next day!   Food: 4/5, freshest asian noodles in manhattan Ambience: 3/5 funky asian noodle house meets hipster warehouse vibe in Chelsea market but lack seating at the long bar  Service: 4/5 super efficient and terse, fine for a New York spot  Value: 4/5, good amount of quality food for $12-$15
5 I am obsessed. I was visiting from out of town and had a chance to stop by Chelsea Market to try Very Fresh Noodles. I went around lunchtime on a Saturday so the line was moderately long. I had to wait about 20 minutes for my meal and it was definitely worth the wait. The dan dan noodles were amazing. Spicy, sesame seedy, crunchy, garlicky. I really wanted to try the Taiwanese beef noodle soup as well but it was too warm outside for hot soup. I will definitely grab lunch here again on my next trip back.
5 Love love love! My first and favorite experience eating these hand pulled noodles. Xi'an Famous Foods offers similar noodles but I think this one takes the cake for me.   Came back to try it a second time in over a year and so happy to see the new remodel and their continued success. I got the tingly beef and it's was perfection- just as good as I remembered. They give you lots of thick noodles and a good amount of thick juicy beef!   Order it to go so you get a lid! You can take your meal with you and try to find a seat elsewhere because the stools are usually all full. Side note: buying water at the supermarket downstairs is cheaper.
2 I was super excited to try a hand pulled noodle spot NOT in Chinatown and was amped given the reviews.   I felt let down when I got here. The lack of AC was terrible since it was humid AF and prob needed given the hot bowls of soupy noodz being served up. (Not their fault but it contributes to the experience). The line moves quickly and they do help you pick if you're stuck. I chose the Taiwanese Beef Noodle soup ($16 w/ tip). They give you a number and make each bowl to order.   While I waited, I found a seat on the side of the shop which has large glass panels to let you see inside the kitchen which is cool.  What's not cool is that customers do not clean up after themselves and it doesn't seem the staff have much time to come out and check on the area.  They have giant rolls of paper towels in lieu of napkins so grab some before you sit down.   They turn orders around pretty quickly and customers don't linger after eating so you'll have a good chance of having a front row spot to the kitchen. If it's full, walk a few feet over and you'll find some tables which are not for any specific shop. This is good if you're getting food with friends and everyone is getting from diff places.. you can all convene here and share.   Back to my noodz..I was disappointed for a few reasons: 1) the noodles were a bit too soft by the time I got them 2) the soup was way too oily (they were overly generous with the chili oil) 3) the bok choy was not cooked and half raw.  4) I didn't care for the beef... it was too soft for my liking (but I really only get TW beef noodles for one thing.. I'm in it for the carbs and soup secondly).   I was debating on ordering something to go when I placed this order and was glad I just got one to see how it is.   Disclaimer: I'm kind of obsessed with TW food and go to TW once a year for the GOOD STUFF.. therefore I just might be overly judgmental about it since there are many other positive reviews on here....
5 They make paste out of mushrooms. And I am allergic to mushroom, I get projectile vomiting as reaction.  My husband ordered vegan dan dan noodles, it was so spicy but delicious. I decided to go ahead and order one for myself. So far no reaction, I assume amount of mushroom they use to make paste is not that much. Finger crossed!   Hope they accommodate people with mushroom allergy.But amazing amazing noodles, best in nyc at price point. Surely going again!   There were rumours about MSG , but i care more about mushrooms ;)
5 Very happy I found this while perusing and looking for a bite after walking the highline. You can find walking either on 15th or through Chelsea Market but I find it easy just walking from 15th since it's by the door and if there is not enough seating you can eat outside but I have to tell you, the workers all tell me to eat it and mix the noodles immediately or it'll get soggy especially the beef noodle soup aka la Mei Taiwanese beef noodle soup $12.86 either a choice of mild or spicy  which has slow braised beef shanks cooked for hours and their fresh hand pulled noodles served with pickled mustard greens, bob Chou, scallions, cilantro and a touch of chili oil. The other known dish, you have to have a steel stomach to handle he very spicy Dan Dan Mian $11.94 you can go vegan or pork both are banging, but I must say they kept it real with the ma la spices loaded with scallions, cucumber and fried broad beans which try to save you when the spices are loaded in the noodles. You have to mix before eating the Dan Dan noodles and taking that flick to share. A great appetizer to share is their cleaver smashed cucumbers  $4.59 which has some sweet chili and sesame soy vinaigrette, most people compare their noodles with Xi'an or even Chinatown's Super Taste/Tasty Pulled noodles which all are quite similar when it comes to the texture of the noodles. Last thing they have a vegetarian option for those who are vegan so don't worry, the vegan options are just as good, and if you want dessert you can go for their bubble tea options to put out the fire out since you ain't got no pepto. Take the challenge!
5 Very Good Noodles. Or that is what VFN should be called, because that is what they offer.   I came on a brutally cold winter's day for lunch, splitting the tingly cumin lamb with soup and the very spicy dan dan mian. My only complaint was that I ultimately could not determine which of the two bowls I loved more. The broth of the cumin lamb was very hearty and helped defrost our beat down bodies. Meanwhile, the familiar Sichuan spice of the dan dan noodles was to die for. Let's just call it a draw.  The menu is simple - the only two other noodle dishes are a vegan noodle with mock duck and a Taiwanese beef noodle soup. I can say without hesitation that VFN is in my opinion the best place to eat in Chelsea Market. Come at me Los Tacos No. 1.
2 I really like this shop but i stopped a couple of times within their business hours & they were closed. Unprofessional  & unreliable.
5 Taiwanese date approved!!!! GET THE SPICY one. SOOOOO GOOOOOOOD.  The beef was so tender and delicious. The noodles had just the right amount of chewyness. Thanks bok choy and radishes were just the right quantities in the broth. So good wowowowowowow. Quaint little hawker bar stand type of seating in Chelsea market. Highly recommended!!
5 I went to the Chelsea market looking for oysters.. I had that along with two sandwiches and beers all within a short timespan.   When I stumbled upon Very Fresh Noodles, I wasn't hungry but wanted to try it because I didn't know when I would be in NYC again.  No freaking regrets!  I couldn't stop eating it.   Typically I do low carb, so I'm used to putting my noodles aside.  Typically soups are the star of the show for me, then meats.. then noodles.   For me the noodles were center stage here, but the soup and meats were equally delicious!   The broth was super rich and flavorful with all the herbs.  The meat was generous and tender.  Thanks to them, I'm now on a hunt for hand torn noodles in spicy beef soup.   I seriously can't stop thinking about them.
5 The best Chinese noodle ever. The best noodle in the world. Omg! They cook in front of you. The meat in the noodle is so damn good! I tried the cucumber today and it is the best!
3 Enjoyed being able to see the noodles being mad however I didn't think the broth was that flavor full and for me the noodles were gummy.
5 This place is amazing! My wife and I make a trip Into the city when we are in New York visiting family just to have lunch here. The choices in Chelsea Market can be overwhelming, but this is a must do for any noodle lover. Very Fresh Noodles won't disappoint. The Taiwanese Beef Soup is the go to, but the Spicy Dan Dan noodles are also great. I find the Tingly Cumin Lamb to be a little overwhelming and palate numbing.  TravellerTip: Chelsea Market where Very Fresh Noodles is full of cool shops and other food options. The Market is also connected to the High Line which is a fun walk before or after you enjoy your noodles and a nice way to spend a few hours in the city.
1 Terrible service first couldn't even find the place there's 3 425 buildings with the same address there's no seating here too crowded screw this place so not worth my time places like this make me hate New York your google directions are so off takes you to a random apartment building doesn't even show signs it's inside Chelsea market at all the cashier ppl looked overwhelmed lost and confused couldn't seat all the people waiting for food
3 It's decent  I got a mild La Mei Taiwanese Beef Noodle. I thought the noodles were a bit chewy and the broth lacked flavor, but there is a generous amount of beef brisket in the soup. More than enough, even for a big eater like me. I did not find the noodles to be anything particularly special in comparison to other noodles I've eaten. However, if you are in a rush this is definitely the place to go. Your order will be ready within 5 minutes. By the way, they do add cillantro! Don't forget to ask them to leave it out if you're not a fan of it.   My top 3 reasons to come here   * Generous portion size   * Wait time   * Friendly Staff
5 Love this noodles soup, it is super flavorful and tasty. Only down side is that it's very busy so you might have to wait for seating areas... also is not a restaurant, it's like a chipotle or subway where you order and go your way. A couple of things in the menu but that's all you need, I order the taiwanese beef noodles which is the 3rd choice. No parking but I went on Sunday so parking was available rather fast. I spend only $15 because I ordered the pasta meal and water. It's a big portion so you'll be full. Great customer service as well!!!
5 As a Taiwanese who's had many different beef noodle soup, this is definitely one of the best beef noodle soup in town! The beef is cooked to perfection that it matches perfectly with the soup.  10/10 would recommend if you want a good beef noodle soup!
5 This place is amazing. I got the mock "duck" vegan soup and it was to die for!! The hand pulled noodles are so delicious and the broth is super savory. I've never had Taiwanese  food but this place has turned me into a fan. I will definitely be visiting again.
4 Had wanted to go to Chelsea Market for a while and my friend took me here! I didn't even know the treat I would soon be in for... Ordered the Cumin Lamb soup (big Xian cumin food fan) for $14  Pros: -quick preparation -large portion! I felt like I was eating for a good amount of time -flavor!! Which is a big one because I felt the broth had such a great taste -you can watch the people handdrawing the noodles in front of you through the window  -noodle texture was just right: a little chewy but also soft -good amount of lamb meat  (As you can see I really loved it and want to go back)   Cons: -there weren't enough seats so I had to stand while eating -the soup was so hot, temperature wise, that it actually got me sweating pretty hard! Maybe it was also that the environment was a bit hot too?  Tips:  If you like your noodle soup spicy, don't be afraid to ask for spicy chili oil on the side! Add it in and there's even more flavor :)
3 VFN is probably the best value meal you'll find at Chelsea Market (which gets pricier year by year, to be honest) but doesn't quite match up to that other very famous Chinese noodle place with multiple NYC locations (cough XFF cough).  Served a little below the right temperature, the dry version of the Tingly Cumin Lamb noodles were not my favorite. The hand-ripped noodles gummed up at the bottom of the bowl, and the sheer amount of cumin overpowered all the other tastes in the dish - yes, even covering the almost non-existent Sichuan peppercorns and chili oil. The lamb slices were decent and held up against the flavor of the sauce, though a truly "dry" preparation wouldn't have so much soup at the bottom of the bowl anyway.  My friend's Very Spicy Dan Dan Mian were better, but probably wouldn't please Sichuan aficionados. The peanut sauce imparted too much sweetness to the mix, but the spiciness was at the right level for the average American consumer. The wheat noodles were cooked with more finesse than in the other dish, with a nice chew and springiness. And of course, the ground pork was seasoned well.  Bonus points for having two vegan options, one with mock duck and the other with soy protein. VFN is worth a try, in my opinion, but would I try it again? Doubtful.
5 Over the years, I have eaten countless bowls of Taiwanese Beef Noodle Soup, and this was easily one of the best bowls I have had! The noodles are handmade on the spot, served with tasty broth, and topped traditionally with bok choy, cilantro, and Chinese pickles.  The noodles were thick and chewy, just as they should be. The portion of noodles was also quite generous, leaving me quite full. The quality of the beef served was also very noteworthy, having very little fat while still being incredibly tender. The entire combination made for an ideal bowl of Taiwanese Beef Noodle Soup.  Just be aware that there is very little seating and very long lines. Being located within Chelsea Market, there is a large crowd that comes here during lunch time. Other than the business of the shop, the food and speed of service were both outstanding!
4 Ordered the Dan Dan. Spice level was good. I would have preferred them slicing the skin off the cucumbers more as they were tough to eat. It didn't balance the dish well since the noodles were soft and chewy and the cucumber were rough. That's why I deducted a star.
5 I was scared but eager to try this place but I seen so many good reviews on it and so I had to give it a try. I ordered the Taiwanese beef soup (spicy) it was very flavorful and the noodles were very good as well as the broth. The soup was about $11-$12 and trust me your getting your moneys worth. they give a good size portion and generous with the amount of beef they give you. if you plan on buying I suggest sharing with someone because it's sooo much and very filling.
5 I saw this place on instagram and tried it out. Trust me it's not raved about enough. If you're in Chelsea market you have to try it. Sometimes there is a wait and line is long but they have a quick turn around so it's not too bad. 10/10 would recommend!
5 Kind of pricey at ~$13 for a bowl but their cumin lamb noodles were so gooooood! They were very generous with the lamb, and the noodles were a a delightful chewy texture. Flavorful, yet not overwhelmingly spicy. My bowl was ready in a minute. Definitely my favorite place in Chelsea market!
1 Had very spicy dan dan noodle. Bas taste and quality. I don't usually leave food leftover but I did.
4 Tucked away in the Chelsea market, this is one place not to be missed! While the line was long, it moved along at a fair pace. There are only a few options to order on the menu, and it looks like you pretty much have to get them as written, though some menu options can be mild or spicy/ dry or soup. We ordered the Taiwanese beef noodle soup and waited for it to be made. It took about ten minutes for the order to be ready, but you can watch them make it and you realize a lot of care goes into constructing each and every bowl. They give you a very generous amount of all ingredients for your order, which makes the sticker price a little less shocking. I mean c'mon, this is Manhattan. Everything is expensive for the most part. Anyway, it was absolutely worth the wait! This was a carefully crafted little bowl of love! The noodles had a fantastic bite to them due to the handmade and extremely fresh nature of them. They aren't mushy, but just gummy and irregular enough to make them a nice experience and very filling. The greens were wilted to perfection and the beef was tender and divine. I lived in China for quite some time and I can honestly say the broth rivaled almost any bowl I ever had there. It was rich and complex, hot and tasty. I will definitely return for a try of the spicy cumin lamb next time. I definitely recommend a visit.
5 I've had so many different variations of Taiwanese beef noodle soup and this place didn't fall short of my expectations. Very Fresh Noodles is located inside Chelsea market. It's more usually for take out, however there are a few seats. It's a stand with bar height stools. You can watch as they prepare the noodles which is actually really entertaining.   I got the spicy beef noodles. It was a pretty decent portion. There's a big pile of thick noodles with a few pieces of beef chunks. It also comes with bok choy in the dish which is the traditional way of serving it. On the top are scallion and cilantro garnishes that give the dish a fresh aspect. The broth is super flavorful so there's no need to add salt or soy sauce. It is a little oily but it's nothing too crazy. My favorite part of this dish is the noodles. The noodles are really thick and chewy in the best way. They are definitely a mouth-fill.   If you're a fan of Taiwanese beef noodle soup, you've got to stop by here. I can't really speak for the other dishes but I'm excited to try them next time I come by.
4 Same feelings as last time I came here. Super friendly staff, broth is really delicious! I took my order to go this time, and they're really wonderful for separating noodles from the broth. The broth is VERY oily, but very spicy and tasty. The beef in the soup is incredibly tender and delicious--noodles were all the same texture this time, which was great, even after a 45 minute commute. I don't want to take stars away because this is more of a preference of mine, but the noodles just aren't firm enough for me, so I probably won't be back. Definitely come for the beef, but if you like firmer noodles and less oily food, this may not be your #1 choice.
3 First time I came here was about a week ago and it was awesome, I ordered the Beef Noodle Soup spicy and asked for extra spicy sauce to add if needed.  Be careful I ended up pouring the entire hot sauce and it made it way too spicy, and this is coming from someone that can't eat without spicy sauce.   So just put little at a time until you reach the spicy level you like.  I also tried the tingly cumin beef "soup" and I really couldn't decide which one is better, they are both good.  The broth is deep and very flavorful, the noodles were tasty, fresh and the right texture.  It was an excellent experience.  Now, why the 3 stars?, I came back week after because I was craving it since I tried it for the first time.   But this time, something was off, the broth didn't quite taste as good as the first time and also the noodles were completely the wrong texture, little slimy and way too thin.  Maybe it was the wrong batch but just didn't do it for me and I couldn't even finish it.
2 I've always been a loyal fan of this place. Unfortunately my last experience was less than satisfactory due to a very rude employee taking the customer orders.   I ordered the mock duck soup, it's my go to every time I come here. I asked the girl taking orders (Asian girl with black round glasses) for a slight modification on my soup. I asked for the soup to be less oily. She snapped back at me with major attitude. Her tone of voice was loud and rude, as if she refused to cater to the customer and respond in a pleasant manner. "We can't change that about the soup!" she shouted. Instead of making a friendly suggestion of ways I could have the soup less oily, she just shut me down. I was so put off by her that I couldn't believe a customer service worker would not offer satisfactory customer  service. Please re-train her, she obviously needs to work on her attitude.
5 Came here again today, on a super hot day.  I was in the area looking around for a good lunch spot, and I think I knew I was craving this place already even though though the weather was super hot.  I ordered the cumin lamb soup again, and these spicy pickles.  So worth it eating this soup in the hot weather, I would do it again!
5 After seeing some of the reviews I seriously cannot understand anything under 5 stars. My girlfriend is Taiwanese so she knows authentic and these noodles are awesome. I'm new to this whole world of noodles but last year when I came here we only got to eat here on one day and it was amazing.  Let's put it this way, I used to make fun of my girlfriend regarding noodles and didn't understand what the big deal was until I ate here. Now I get it  I've been in New York for a week and a half and have already eaten there three times and plan to go back tonight. This has to be some of the best food I've ever had, the noodles are insane and the broth is delicious, I mean incredibly delicious. Thank God my girlfriend didn't finish hers and I got to eat the rest. Amazing food
5 Dan Dan Mian with traditional pork.  Best noodles we've ever had hands down. So fresh, spicy and delicious! I'm going to crave these noodles for the rest of my life!!
1 Taiwanese beef noodles- perhaps the noodles sat too long in broth or I came on a bad day. The noodles had the texture of raw pizza dough. It wasn't chewy, best I can describe it is that it was like eating raw dough. Pieces of beef were pretty good, very tender. Broth was way too greasy with chili oil. I couldn't really taste the essence of the broth because of it.   Cleaver smashed cucumber- cucumbers were neatly cut into large chunks. The skin of the cucumber was really thick and tough. If the cucumbers had been smashed, the texture would have been very different. Too much oil in the dressing and I tasted a lot of sugar on the top of the pile.  Vegan dan dan noodles. Meh... Noodles were not chewy.   Overall meh. All three items weren't appetizing enough to finish. First time and last time here.
4 Hidden inside Chelsea Market, this place has a limited menu but is sure to excite the tastebuds!  Only qualm was the noodles being just a bit too big and "lumpy" as it was hard to get a decent spoonful without shoving half the noodles in at once.   They add beef fat to every bowl which makes it sooo umptous.   Grab lots of napkins and don't wear white!  Kind of pricey, around $13 for a bowl. Enough to share though!
5 Absolutely loved this place. The food is packed with flavor and the service was amazing. We got to sit and watch the guy make the noodles as we ate. It was a wonderful experience and very reasonably priced for what you get.
4 This place is a great spot in Chelsea Market. They've upgraded to a bigger kitchen/space to meet demand. Some seating around it which is nice. The noodles are chewy and thick. Quite spicy and so good. Highly recommend.
5 Their noodles are off the  chart! I am overly obsessed with this place after visiting for the first time. If you are a noodle lover you def have to come here and try their tingly beef noodle. Dry or soup, both are good. Wow just wow!! I also tried the lamb tingly and Taiwanese beef noodle soup. They are all really good! Flavorful and powerful with the right amount of heat. Price is also very reasonable. Typing this makes me wanna drool already.. I can't wait to be back!
4 This was one of two places I wanted to try for the beef noodle soup. The other is Ho Foods. My friends said great things about the broth here and even the noodles (but Xi'an Famous Food's noodles were ranked higher). For me, I prefer smaller thing noodles like Lo Mein sized so the wide fat noodles weren't a huge hit for me but they were still good. Broth was good too and they put a variety of vege's in there. The one point I'd leave people with is that there is plenty of beef in there so no need to ration some for each bite! Seating isn't abundant right there since it's just a bar counter and I'd bring your own water bottle for eating at the Chelsea Market.
5 Amazing noodles!! So tasty and so flavorful!! Meats are so tender too. Noodles itself is perfectly not perfect and the soup flavors it well. Service is super fast and friendly, even with a long line.
4 We tried the Taiwanese noodles. Noodles definitely very fresh and the beef was excellent. The soup is ok. We got mild which still has a little kick.  Definitely better soup out there. If can improve then would be 5 stars.
4 For someone who loves noodles, this place did not disappoint. This place was packed when we got there. Finding the space to eat was a bit challenging. We ordered:   - Dan Dan Mian $11.94 - this dish is a bit different compare to the traditional Dan Dan Noodle. It needs an acquired taste, but after several bites I'm glad I chose this dish. For some reason, the employee asked me several times whether this is my first time ordering Dan Dan Mian there, and that I should mix the noodle thoroughly as the sauce is mostly on the bottom. The dish is not spicy enough for me, so I asked for an extra chilly sauce on the side.   - La Mei Taiwanese Beef Noodle Soup $12.86 - my friend ordered this, but I tasted it a little. The soup is a bit too sour for me, but I don't mind ordering it again.
5 Excellent. My toddler loved the braised beef and noodles. I loved the Dan Dan noodles. Great quality and value.
4 This place is trying to come for Xian 's Famous Food's neck... I don't think that it's beaten them but they're a good competitor.
3 The cleaved cucumbers (a side dish) was very tasty. It was mostly sweet with a touch of spicy and I really liked that taste. The Tingly Cumin Dry Noodles, on the other hand, was disappointing. The meet was cooked in this carnitas style and due to cumin tasted very Mexican. I guess I shouldn't be surprised but I really didn't like the taste of the meat regardless. Additionally, the noodles, while tasting fresh, was too thick/wide so it felt like I was just eating raw starch/flour.  Update: Just had the very spicy Dan Dan noodles. I thought it had a pretty good blend of regular spicy and numbing spicy flavor, and I really enjoyed the noodle texture / cucumbers. It's a bit more spicy than most Dan Dan noodles I've tried and definitely more spicy than most spicy dishes in general, but not unbearable. If it's anything that'll leave you uncomfortable, I think it'd be the oil.
4 I tried the tingly lamb noodle soup. Which I think is inspired from the xinjiang part of China? Well noodles pretty good and soup very tasty. Perhaps portions a bit too small compared to the price. But it's well worth a try!  Something to consider about, the restaurant doesn't have many seats they have a bar like side where you can sit. So if you visit on a busy day expect to enjoying your noodles standing or siting somewhere awkward.
5 I got the beef noddle with extra chili on the side. The pull noodle was delicious! It had a mild spicy taste prior to me adding more chili. The atmosphere was very lively and upbeat with the loud music! There was a long line when my friends and I order but we were able to get our food fast! Great customer service and excellent food!
3 The photos for this place looked so good that I had to stop by. I had their spicy dan dan mian and was instructed to mix the noodles. Although it was troublesome to mix, I was more disappointed in the taste. The sauce for the noodles was really thick, and the noodles itself was way too dry. Also, a heads up to the spicy lovers out there that this is in fact not as spicy as it seems.
2 Eh. I'm biased when it comes to noodles, because of a number of reasons so I want to say my thoughts on noodles is completely on my own. I've eaten a lot of noodles throughout my life, so when it comes to eating noodles I'm very picky on what is good quality or specifics.   Very Fresh Noodles was on our list because they served and had a version of Taiwan beef noodles. While sitting at the bar next to this massive window of the kitchen and chefs behind the glass and watching them "hand pull" noodles, I started to get questionable. Let's just say, I didn't see much hand pulling. It was more like splitting it in half. They would flatten a piece of dough, and just basically rip it apart. I guess that's a certain style of hand pulling, but to me I was thinking more of skinny noodles and not fat ones. I saw the noodles that they made for the dan dan mian, and it was already done. They didn't pull it and made it for order, but I'm guessing they pulled it ahead of time.  Now, what I had in my mind about Taiwan Beef Noodles wasn't what I ate. What I know when I went to Taiwan, was that it was thin noodles, and not fat noodles. Mainly, I was thinking it was the type of noodles that they made for the dan dan mian, but I guess not. That wasn't that big of a deal, but the noodles were chewy, which made me think that either the dough wasn't good or that it wasn't cooked fully. It was chewy to the point like it was similar to rice noodles.  The broth however wasn't too bad. I felt that it was a little on the sweet side, but overall it was okay. Obviously that I've had better, and I think in New York you can find a better Taiwanese spot. I'm going to say Flushing would be the neighborhood to check out, sadly I didn't have the time to get there but I guess that can be for next time.
5 Absolutely delicious!!! The noodles are made on the spot, soup base is tasty and worth the price.  A bowl full of noodles, broth & lamb  can't ask for anything more.   The service was great from start to finish. Everyone on the floor work hard for their money & when you see that you know there is quality right behind it!!!   Thanks for the great experience Very Fresh Noodles!! Will be back soon !!!
4 Note: This is in the chelsea market.  I came here looking for noodles, and that's what I got. I got the cumin lamb noodles and the beef noodle soup (mild). What I have to say is, the noodles truly are very good. I recommend the lamb noodles (dry) more because it makes the noodles firmer and doesn't let the broth get it soggier. Then you really get to appreciate the noodles and how it's covered in all the delicious oils. The lamb pieces were also a generous portion and you can definitely taste the cumin (but I still wish there were more flavor there)  The beef noodle soup had soooooo much beef. I wish I got the spicier version. The soup has good flavor, but just not great IMO. They use a lot of peanut sauce I think, and that's just not what I like in my noodle soups. The beef was very tender.  If I come here again, I would stick with the cumin lamb and try the dan dan noodles.
5 Oh yah! I first saw the video from food insider and just had to come try it out myself. We went around 3 pm and the line was looong! We got the cumin lamb and beef noodle soup for the main dish and got red bean soy milk for the drink which was surprisingly good! So between the two dishes I would definitely say the cumin lamb had the stronger flavor and I made the mistake of eating that before the beef noodle soup, which was still really good but did taste a little bland after the cumin lamb. The noodles were amazing!
3 Nothing special about these noodles. Just a massed produced over priced product that wouldn't do well in Chinatown among other competition. Takes advantage of location and over zealous American Yelpers that don't know real Chinese can be more than what they offer. ( and cheaper)
5 The service here was amazing. The line was long I waited about 8-10 minutes but the person at the register was a sweet heart and even gave me a free tea because he noticed how sick I was. I had the beef soup and it was so flavorful, the noodles were so silly and smooth and the soup had very big pieces of beef. I would deff go back and try something new!
5 Never thought I'd find a place in the U.S. that does Taiwanese Beef Noodle Soup well. This place is awesome! Reminds me of my childhood, the flavor is very authentic.  Broth is super savory, just the way I like it, and a little spicy. Beef is soft and tender. The veggies were fresh, and the toppings (some pickled vegetables) added to the dish by providing some contrast. The noodles were also chewy, but not gummy. The meal came out piping hot - it was a hot summer evening when we visited, but I can see this place providing a great meal during the colder winter months.  Like others have said, enter from the side street if you want to avoid the tourist-hustle-bustle of Chelsea Market. Expect a line to the register regardless! The counter beside the kitchen is usually full, but if you wander into Chelsea Market proper you'll easily find a table to sit down and enjoy your meal.
2 Located in Chelsea Market, it does well with the tourist crowd, especially since you can see them "pull" the noodles. However, if you had Taiwanese soup noodles before, you will be disappointed. The noodles were super doughy and chewy, and the broth was a tad on the bland side. I love eating any type of noodles and this was the first time I just didn't try to finish them.
5 Could very well be the best soup and noodles I've ever had. Faster than fast food, yet the noodles are made right in front of you. I will look for this place if I ever come back to NYC.
2 Mhmm, I had a lot of expectations for this place, especially with the videos and marketing I saw. Maybe it was just an off-day? I got the TINGLY CUMIN LAMB with soup, and the flavors were just not there...it was quite watered down in my opinion. The noodles and meat were great, but the soup was so disappointing. It smells great when you get the meal and the first bite is great, but the flavor dies once you really dig in.   I've had the same dish at other spots including Xian Foods, and it doesn't compare at all. I ended up not finishing the meal which ended up being $13+ I'll probably go back and try another dish sometime to see if it's any better.
5 WOW WOW WOW  I absolutely love this place the hype is real.   Signature Taiwanese noodles are amazing broth is so flavorful meat its just beyond tender and delicious and the noodles (hand pulled right in front of you) are the perfect texture.   Dan Dan noodles- amazing love the little fried beans that come give a great extra crisp and the meat and sauce is bomb wow.   just go here   tip for New Yorkers-  there is a side door entrance on 15th st and this noodle place is right there because annoyingly so this place is in Chelsea market so no seats anywhere ever and there like 5,678 people all over everywhere but just get you noodles and go!
4 I was super excited to try this place! The dan dam noodles sounded promising but the super spicy part got me scared, but my boyfriend got it and I had a super tiny bite. Definitely SUPER spicy, but amazingly flavorful. If you're someone that can handle the heat, this is definitely the choice for you.   I had the vegan noodles dry with mock duck. Loved the texture of this noodle, thick and chewy. The mock duck tasted like real meat. A generous portion of meat as well! This was spicy as well but at a more manageable level for me. Although I did think it was a bit salty, I enjoyed this a lot. I will be back to try their noodles in soups.  Seating is limited, will probably have better luck outside of where this stand is. I also had the Thai tea which tasted pretty watered down soo I probably wouldn't recommend that.
4 Very fresh noodles indeed!!!   [TAIWANESE BEEF NOODLE SOUP] - $12.86 - Fat noodles with the perfect thickness for the flavor to permeate throughout. The beef was SOOOOO tender and chunky! Broth had amazing flavor but on the heavier side. I love drinking soup but this I could not finish (even though I wanted to...)  [VERY SPICY DAN DAN MIAN] - $11.94 - Numbing kind of spice! Delicious but it hurts to eat. Do not attempt if you're not used to spicy food :p Delicious tho!  [TINGLY CUMIN LAMB] - $12.86 - Only had a few bites of this and it was YUMMMMMMMY.   Definitely coming back here the next time I'm in Chelsea Market!  *Very limited seatings. Get here a little earlier (around 5pm) if you want to sit down and enjoy. The area was very crowded by 6pm.
5 Hand pulled noodles, flavorful broth, and tender meat! I would highly recommend this spot.
5 Excellent! Huge! So delicious, generous portions. Our whole party loved every dish. Dry lamb is great. Beef noodle soup was amazing!
5 This place is incredible! I was standing at bar by glassed in kitchen when I had my first taste of the La Mei Taiwanese beef noodle soup. How stupid I was, to think I would rush through this meal. I promptly moved to a table, took off my jacket and savoured each bite/sip slowly. The spice level was perfect, a little bit of heat to bring out the proper tingles you should get when having such a meal. The chrysanthemum tea was just right for cutting through the heat as well.   If you are ever in or around Chelsea Mkt, this is the place to eat. Especially perfect for a Winters day!   I wish I had taken pictures, but the meal was too good and distracted me...or consumed me
5 Get the Beef Noodles, they are the best noodles in the city! I used to only go to Chinatown to enjoy authentic noodles but they are really good here. The Lamb was not my favorite because I don't like lamb and the lamb fat, but the Vegan Noodles were really good! I've only experienced one off-day where the soup tasted water, but the quality is consistent
4 Love it! Go every time when I visit Chelsea market. Freshly made beef noodle with tasty broth & the dry noodle are MUST try.
5 I actually really enjoy this place! The first time we grabbed the Tingly Cumin Lamb just on a whim and were super surprised how tasty it was so on this NYC trip we made sure we stopped by here for the same thing.   First, although it can get a bit busy the employees here are super friendly and willing to explain any of the menu to you. Second, it sucks that because it's in Chelsea Market there is a lack of seating, don't let that stop you. Third, it can be a bit spicy but it's so tasteful and it feels good for the soul! Not sure what type of noodles it is but it's super thick noodles which is different than most noodle places.   I can't say much about much of the rest of the menu because we found what we like and we're sticking with it! But the employees are very accommodating. Once, it took a few minutes for us to get our order since we had went to order donuts as well and one of the chefs remade it without us even saying anything because he wanted us to have it fresh and didn't want us to have soggy noodles so that says a lot about the customer service.   Definitely try it out!
4 Amazing, spicy, rich, flavorful, tasty, authentic, tingly beef noodles! A bowl full of spicy tingly happiness with the thick raw cut noodles. There is basically no seating because it is a little corner and not a full restaurant, but it is truly yummy! And pretty for Instagram.
4 I stopped by at a friends recommendation. I really enjoyed the chew of these noodles, as they were just perfectly cooked with the right texture. I had the spicy dan dan with pork, and it was definitely flavorful. I want to return to try a broth noodle soup next time, as something in the dan dan was a tad too overpowering.  Overall a solid recommendation.
5 My first experience with this restaurant was at Chelsea Market and it was an instant hit with me . Everything is made from scratch and you get to actually see them threw the glass as they prepare your meal .
4 This is a very delicious bowl of food.  I am talking about the tingly cumin lamb ordered dry.  But the best place to eat it is at home, near a couch or bed, with someone who will still love you even though you are covered in splashes of lamb juice, with bits of herbs and spices stuck in your teeth, and a thin glaze of sweat on your face from the Szechuan peppercorns.  It's very rich and you will fall into a profound coma after you eat it - hence the couch or bed.  Despite all the caveats, you will not be disappointed - deeply flavorful, fresh, lamb-y, and totally satisfying.  Minus a star for the eternally ditzy service.  You tell them you want it to go but they never remember.  You order a drink at one side of the counter and it fails to migrate to the other.  Add in a few dozen perplexed tourists and it's enough of a discouragement that I've walked on by on several occasions.
5 These noodles are so damn good. I had the vegan bowl with mock duck, shiitake mushrooms and bok choy. The broth was rich and had just the right amount of that Sichuan tingle. I don't know how they make the mock duck but it was a miracle. Freshly pulled noodles were soft but not mushy at all. Delicious!
4 These noodles are located in Chelsea market, which is ALWAYS busy when I go. But they're soo worth it. These noodles are one long trail of delicious thick noodles that are NEVER ENDING. They are pricy ($14 for one), but they are so yummy, and they satisfy my noodle cravings every time. The broth is a little oily for me, and the taste can be a little overwhelming. I always get the beef noodles, and the beef is one of the most tender pieces of meat I've ever had.
5 BEST. SOUP. EVER!  Located in Chelsea Market right by the entrance, this place is too good to pass up. Fresh, hand pulled noodles made to order is enough to round up a crowd. Luckily they move quickly but efficiently here, so every bowl is made excellent.   I ordered the la Mei Taiwanese beef soup spicy. The slow braised beef meltsssss in your mouth. Portions are really big as well. I ate so much and still had enough for a 2nd serving. The noodles are nothing what i could've prepared myself for. it didn't taste like a typical noodle. it was 8ft long, soft and tender but didn't make you feel stuffed right away. this soup is ridiculously flavorful. Words cant describe. please, please check this place out.   Customer service was just as good. Convenient, well detailed menus located by the registers. The cashier took my order and the server came to find me when it was done. (i wandered to the side to watch the hand pull noodle being made) The soup are in bowls that can be covered really well and they give a paper bag inside a plastic bag. It held up SUPER good because i took my 2nd half of soup, throughout central park and all the way back to queens with no issues at all.   seating is a little tricky, but honestly in NY, you do what u gotta do for a seat just like you do on the subway. u see a seat, grab it lol. Whether theyre busy or slow, service is always 5 star!  Please, whatever you're doing at very fresh noodle, keep it up! Thank you for the best soup ever.
2 I've been here twice for lunch.  First time: very spicy dan dan mien  Second time: spicy, tingly beef noodles (dry)   I was very excited to see this come up on yelp as a lunch option. I love freshly made noodle soups and dishes.   The first time: dan dan mien- what can I say? It was very soft and mushy. It was also very very very oily and bland. I really did not enjoy the meal at all. I felt like the hype overly promised and totally way under-delivered.   The second time: the spicy beef noodles.  The taste of this dish is actually pretty good. There is a nice heat and mixture of ingredients. The noodles again- were very mushy. Maybe they're cooking it too long?   Their food remind me a little of Xian's Famous Foods except not good. It's like the bootleg version except it costs more.   I wouldn't recommend the food here at all, but the people working here are so nice and cheerful! That's what the two stars are for. :)   I'm going to give this place one more shot and then I'm out!
4 I ordered the Taiwanese beef noodle soup and asked if  they could split it for me, which was really nice of them to do. Since they split it, it looked much bigger and they gave us so much more meat than what we thought we would get. There was also just one really long noodle that was impossible to find the end to! It was amazing. I loved how as we walked in we watched one of the chefs pulling the noodle. It was a great experience and I would definitely come back.
3 I tried the Taiwanese beef noodle and was disappointed. The broth doesn't have much flavor. Although the beef was very tender, the flavor wasn't enough either.
4 In the midst of all the small stops in Chelsea Market, this is one you don't want to miss! I've only tried the beef noodle soup (spicy version), and even though I can't handle much spice, I still enjoyed this dish a lot.   One bowl of noodles is around $14, which is a bit pricey but expected in a touristy place like this. Obviously, noodles are freshly made on the spot and you can even watch someone make them!
5 I am constantly craving these noodles. I love the vegan dry noodles. The flavor is so rich, you would never believe it's vegan. They have a strong flavor, but they aren't spicy (unless you want to order it spicy). The noodles themselves need to be eaten fresh, but are unique because of how long they are.   The shop is in Chelsea market which is a good and a bad thing. At times there is no where to sit, but it's still worth it.   I absolutely recommend everyone try Very Fresh Noodles, especially vegans and vegetarians.
5 I had the beef noodle and it was amazing. Rich booth, tender beef and fresh flat noodles. As close as you can get to the real thing in Taiwan.
4 The beef noodle soup is definitely worth a trip coming back for. The beef was tender, broth was flavorful, and the noodles were indeed very fresh. I also tried their taro bubble tea, but it didn't have much flavor even after asking them to add more taro mix. Soup $13, bubble tea $4. Seating is limited.
5 The noodles here is one of the best I've had. I love hot and spicy food, this definitely hit the spot. It's more like that Sichuan spicy which I love! They put a lot of herbs and seasoning which makes the noodle smells so good. I just love this place. I think it's better than xian famous food. I came here a few times and got dry cumin beef since it's just easier to share and carry out as well. I would definitely come back if I am around the area.   They expand the place a bit. Compare to my first time there, it's much roomier and there's actually seating now. It's not a lot of seats so if you go during prime time, it'll probably still be hard to find one.
5 Staff is friendly and the noodles were delicious. They are different than any other kind of noodle I've had and I want more of them! I got the beef broth dish spicy and it was the perfect amount of spice. Would definitely eat here again.
4 My wife wanted to try some, im not a big fan of thick noodles. But these were made fresh because I saw it! Ours is spicy, and the beef is omg buttery soft!  In Chelsea market, limited seating. Staff is nice and you can see all the action going on while you wait for your soup. The broth is not bad you really have to eat the noodles and slurp it together because soup itself is a little bit salty. It is greasy too so if you're fond of greasy soup than go for the greasy slurping, napkin over the lips, experience of your life!  Warning the noodles is longggg so beware it will never end lol.
5 This beats Xi'an's ass! Flavorful broth that's spicy enough but not overwhelming. The noodles with the perfect chewy texture.   Yum yum yum. The downfall is the line and the lack of seating situation but so worth the struggle.
5 So good! Like good! Happy belly ! They make it right when you order and it is fresh as they say!
2 The noodles are made fresh and the price is about right since I received plentiful chunks of beef brisket and noodles but overall, I think something was just missing from this bowl of soup. It didn't wow me that I had to come back and get more.  I guess visiting from the bay, this place just didn't impress me.
2 I love dandan!! The peanut, the noddles, the spice, it really speaks to me...But I couldn't get on the with numb spice level in this one. I understand it's supposed to be that way traditionally but it was just too much.   It's unfortunate because I was really looking forward to them.   Also, the Thai tea was soo mediocre. Hard pass.
1 First of all, I have to clarify this: you can't find the same flavor anywhere else in nyc. I have been here a handful of times since the soft opening, back when you need to wait forty minutes for the food. I only order the cumin lamb and I am addicted to it, which brings me to my rant: Why are you guys ruining your perfect dry cumin lamb? It used to be a proper lamb steak chopped in pieces, then it turned into lamb slices, which I am fine with. But today, lo and behold, mushrooms are creeping into the bowl of noodles!!??? Please guys, don't modify a perfect item.
4 I got the vegan dry noodles with the mock duck and while the noodles themselves were amazing, I thought the flavor was a bit much at times, there was a lot of cumin in it. The sauce was really rich, so I couldn't eat a lot of it all at once, but the texture of the noodles really made up for all of that. The mock duck also had an interesting flavor, at times it was a bit sweet so it was a little off putting. I would definitely go back, but I would get a different type of noodles for sure, but overall delicious. The fact that the noodles are fresh are the main selling point because the texture and the flavor of the actual noodle is amazing.
4 Tiny spot inside Chelsea Market...menu only has a handful of items. Warning! When they say spicy, they mean fricking spicy!!!! I do spicy but this was insane, had to ask for extra broth to make it edible.
1 My girlfriend and I came here hoping to enjoy noodles we saw on insider food. First of all there was barely any selection on the menu, so we chose the signature Tingly Beef Noodle dish to be safe.  The dish was 10% noodles and beef, and 90% straight oil. It was like we were actually drinking literal oil. The entire base of the soup wasn't there because you couldn't see pass the oil. Even after only eating the noodles and the beef we felt disgusting and sick. Because obviously the human body isn't meant to absorb that much oil.  If you do go there, I would suggest getting the dry version of whichever meal you pick. If you don't, get ready to be sick and tired for hours.
4 I was in the neighborhood and stopped by for lunch around 12pm. Within a minute, there was a long line behind me. Service was quick and I got my noodles and drink within 5minutes. I ordered the Taro Bubble Tea and the Taiwanese Beef Noodle (mild). The tea was bland and did not taste like the usual sweet bubble tea that you get at an Asian bakery. The size of the tea is great, too bad it was tasteless. The noodles came with a good amount of meat, bok Choy and various veggie garnishes. Taste wise, it was a decent bowl of soup. The noodles had a good bite. Not the best that I've had but it was enjoyable. There is limited seating, so definitely not good for groups.
5 Bombest Chinese food in Chinatown and so cheap. So much good food and it won't break the bank. Some good friends put us up on it after clubbing uptown. We all hopped in an Uber and went straight to Wo-Hop, the upstairs dining area and we keep going back every time we're in the city
4 Love this place....5 stars for sure if the waiters weren't such A holes. LOL
1 FOOD POISONING BEWARE!!!!!! My boyfriend and I stopped by Sunday July 15th for food. This wasn't our first time there, we always go to WoHop. As soon as I got home I started getting a violent stomach pain. My boyfriend and I were up all night. I was vomiting, I had a violently sharp pain in my stomach, I felt weak, and I do not wish that on my worst enemy. I still have sharp pain in my stomach and I can't eat anything at all, getting around my apartment is a hassle, I can barely walk due to the pain and discomfort. The health department needs to take a look at their kitchen and how they clean their foods. This is the worst case of food poisoning. My boyfriend was lucky enough he stayed away from the shrimp dish we ordered since he isn't really a fan of seafood. Never again will I be returning to wohop. I've been stuck in bed for 4 days because of this.
3 Dirty little hole in the wall. Food was mediocre and prices are average. Guy working there wasn't too bad. Food comes out quick.
3 We knew we wanted to try authentic Chinese food while in NYC but in a sea of restaurants in Chinatown, we had no idea where to start. Yelp to the rescue! Ted zeroed in on this restaurant, tucked into a basement off Mott Street and off we went.   The atmosphere and service is a solid 5-stars. The restaurant is the true definition of hole in the wall with no more than 10 tables and "celebrity" photos and graffitied dollar bills tapped everywhere. The waiters were attentive in their old-school, stained, blue smocks.   Our food swung from 4-stars (egg rolls, duck fried rice) to 2-stars (General Tso's Chicken -- too "saucy" and soggy, egg drop soup -- too thick and bland). So, I'm landing at 3-stars for Wo Hop. Next time we're in the city, I'd like to check out another Chinatown restaurant to compare.
5 Delicious food - open 24 and great local vibe. I had the egg drop soup, special of the day salt pepper soft shell crab.....slammin.
3 Well we touched the stone at Wo Hop at the recommendation of family. Should've not followed that advice. The Lo Mein we ordered was heavily sauced and the chicken in was not charred in a wok it was stewed white meat and it was easy to tell. And who the heck sauces Lo Mein?! More than half of the Schezwan shredded beef was bamboo shoots. Good photos on the wall and maybe tasty for late night bender food but a poor choice in NYC.
2 If you want dumbed down for the American tourist Chinese, this is the place for you.  My husband and I had dinner at Wo Hop and both ordered what should have been spicy dishes.  Neither was anywhere close to where it should have been.  You can get better General Tso's chicken at an American chain restaurant.  My husband's garlic shrimp was likewise boring.  We also ordered shrimp fried rice, and while we didn't expect that to be spicy, it should have been flavorful, and it wasn't.  Avoid this tourist trap.
4 Really good - came highly recommended from multiple locals.  The food was delicious and came out fast.  The fried wontons were excellent.  We also got sesame chicken, chicken lo mein and chicken fried rice.  Everything had great flavor and the atmosphere was really cool...hidden gem off the street.
3 This was a bit disappointing came here based on a friends recommendation that it was the best Cantonese food in Chinatown, well turns out that the father's restaurant is downstairs  the son's  was upstairs not quite sure which is better but I ate at Dads. If I went back I definitely go upstairs. Paragraph had several items can't say any of them were impressive.   By the way it's a cash only restaurant they don't necessarily make a point of telling you that. Don't expect service to be much about taking your order and giving you your food. If you need something else You will need to get up and wave your hand
2 Everyone seems to love this place. I cannot bring myself to love the food here. Maybe it was what I ordered? I'll give it shot again in the future.
5 Amazing hole on the ground! We ordered 3 dishes. Soft shell crabs, out of this world. Wonton soup with squid, shrimp, ducks, roasted pork, veggie, all in one humongous bowl and it tasted incredible. And the fried dumplings are just unbelievable . So much good food and the price is excellent too. Highly recommend this place. This is 17 Mott st. Hole on the ground, not 15 Mott st, the one on street level. Absolutely will come back again.
4 Best late night Chinese food. Food is delicious and served quickly.  Make sure to head downstairs. No frills old style place with laminated tables. Don't let the look fool you. The food is GREAT!
3 This place is considered a Chinatown institution but it's also just as much of a tourist trap with a over blown legend.  Mostly tourists, no locals.  The food is solid Chinese/Cantonese cuisine but it's nothing outstanding.  Yes it's open late which is a plus.
5 This is one of my all time favorite Chinese Restaurants! I've been going here for almost 20 years. The décor hasn't changed and most of the waiters are the same. Food is excellent! Huge servings. Service is great! I recommend the Fried Dumplings, Fried Rice and the Beef with Oyster Sauce. My only complaint is they use bean spouts which I am not a fan of. I have to remember to ask for them to be removed. They accommodate without any problems! Amazing restaurant!! It's open 24 hours. Make sure you go downstairs. It makes a difference!! Definitely visit when your in the city! Just don't expect much from the décor. It's part of the charm!
4 The Chinese food here is not what I would call "authentic" - the food is much too greasy for that, the sauces have that characteristic Westernized sweet flavor and the fact that egg foo young is on the menu. But food doesn't have to be authentic to taste good, and the food here tastes pretty damn delicious. Highlights of the night were:  - Yellow chives and eggs - eggs were cooked to a soft, fluffy texture, chives tasted fresh, and everything was seasoned well. Would have been an otherwise perfect rendition of the the classic Chinese dish if it weren't for the pathetically looking wilted lettuce leaves that somehow made it onto the plate as garnish - Meat pie with Chinese sausage - the meat itself was a tad bland but tasted amazing once you dip it in this super flavorful oily soup that it was served with. The Chinese sausage were a bit superfluous in my opinion (but at least not as sad as the lettuce I mentioned in the previous dish).  We also ordered the fried vegetable dumplings but weren't so into those. The dough was fried to a crisp (think crab rangoon, as opposed to the gently fried skins that's typical of traditional potstickers) and the filling was not tasty enough to compensate for the crispy dough.   This is one of the only places in Chinatown that's open 24 hours so it's perfect for satisfying late night cravings. The service is decent and every meal finishes with a plate of sliced oranges. I guess a nice way to mitigate for the amount of grease that you likely just consumed during your meal.
3 First things first. Wo Hop gets four stars from me for nostalgic reasons. The service here is five stars. The food is worth three. And the atmosphere might be worth one or two.  This tiny basement dive was the first restaurant I ever patronized in New York City. It was June, 1994. My future wife (at the time) took me there on a date. We've been married almost a quarter-century and she's taken me there just about every time we visit from Texas. The place is always packed, and the waiters still wear those dorky K-Mart blue shirt/jackets.   The atmosphere is dank, yet brightly lit with cheap fluorescent tubes. Tables are so close that you can pick up on any four conversations at once. It seems dirty, but I think it's just all the vinyl and age -- and the fact that this joint is open 24-7.   Food here is cooked to order, and it has never been anything better than mediocre. Better than the mall, but probably not as good as other places in the same block. For example, the hot & sour soup is on the sweet side. The eggplant is decent, but feels like it was cooked in a 1,000-degree wok for a minute too long. But they don't skimp on ingredients or portions. Noodle dishes, I've realized, are consistently good. So too are the huge vegetable-filled egg rolls. And all you have to do is look up, and someone will bring you an ice cold Tsing Tao to was everything down.  Wo Hop is fun. And though I've never left the place thinking that it's the best I've ever had, I've always left happy. I will continue coming back here as long as both of us are alive and kicking. Next time, I might even add my signed dollar bill to the crowded walls.
2 It's a novelty restaurant, the chinese food is real, but I'm saying it's not anything special.  I wouldn't go again because of seeing multiple cockroaches and the basement level smelling like roach spray.  Hygiene is very important to me and for that reason I cannot recommend them or give them a positive review.  The service btw was standard, nothing to write home about.
1 Probably some of the most generic Chinese food in Chinatown. It's a bad sign when the place is full of midwestern tourists, but sadly that didn't deter us. We were already seated. Rude staff (woman behind us walked because the waiter screamed at here lol). Food- wonton soup, over cooked and chewy wontons. Squid in garlic sauce, like have chewing gum in a sweet starch muck. Chicken kung pao, dry slices of chicken floating in a bland also too starchy sauce. I guess the white rice was ok. Oh and did I say it was filthy. Because it is.  Do yourself a favor and go anywhere else.
5 Wo Hop is always my go to whenever I'm in Chinatown. It never fails to please my taste buds and service is always wonderful.   Fried squid and Fried fish dishes are the best! MUST TRY  (Bathrooms are located downstairs)
5 So my first time in China Town I was brpught here. I was told this was the best Chinese Food in NY.   Now, I certainly have notbeaten at every Chinese restaurant in NY...that could be a whole book of reviews. But it was the best Chinese food I have ever had.   People talk about the wait...we got soooo lucky, we waited maybe 5 mins. Maybe. It was early on a Sat. Like 6ish, so the dinner rush hadn't hit.  The walls are covered with celebrities who have come and enjoyed all Wo Hop has to offer. You breathe in a mix of nostalgia with the pictures and the vintage mix up of tables. Definitely a place your eyes won't get bored.  We ordered a smorgasbord of food. Ribs, rice, orange chicken, chow fun, egg rolls....it was a table full of food.   Everything was really really good. Portions would have made a King blush. And the price...I think with 4 drinks and all that food and tip it was like $50. Not bad for 4 huge meals, drinks and apps.   So if you are in China Town you really can't pass up Wo Hop!
5 This place is the OG. I have been coming here ever since I was born, and I have never been dissapointed in this. I have always loved this place and keep coming back for more. Go to the downstairs spot, its where all the dank food is.   It is an authentic, genuine, place that always leaves me satisfied. I would recommend it!
4 To be honest I am no expert when it comes to the culinary scene in NYC. However it takes no expert to know that this place serves up some great food. The fried rice was a little bland for my taste, but everything was extremely tasty. I would definitely make a move for the garlic beef. WARNING: you will walk out of this establishment feeling like you just gained half your body weight.
4 *BRING CASH!*  + Open very late. Not exactly sure what time they close but they were definitely open at 4am.  + Pretty tasty. I had the jumbo shrimp and broccoli and it was yummy.  + Portions are pretty generous.  - Cash only. It was when we went, at least. Not sure if it usually is but there was a printed paper on the door that notified us of the policy.  - Service is definitely lacking. The waiters don't really care. Don't expect any politeness or courtesy. My friend was scooping leftover garlic sauce into her bowl of rice and the waiter literally grabbed it out of her hands, mid-scoop. It was comical.  - Prices are a bit high. My shrimp (they were jumbo prawns but still) and broccoli was $15. I had a hard time finding cheaper main dishes on the menu. Most things started at $12.
3 This place is known as THE place to go in for Chinese food. Go travel down to the distant foreign land of Chinatown, journey down a mysterious stairway and you're greeted by a very interesting decor. Wallpapered by money this place looks interesting. However, the food is well nothing spectacular. A wide variety, yes, but nothing sOooOooo delicious that I feel the need to go back.
2 When it's 4am & the bar closes & your stomach is filled with nothing but alcohol, this is the place to go. The food was really salty. Everything is greasy. The chicken sauce was watered down but kudos to this place for opening 24/7.
4 I live relatively close to Wo Hop. It has always been there. It is not my go-to spot, yet I could never rule it out. Whether you are sitting downstairs or upstairs, the food comes out quick, their portions are substantial and the food pretty tasty. Ordering the crispy wontons to start is a must. Greasy, thick, crunchy. It sets you up nicely for what's about to come. I'm a big fan of the thin-noodle mei fun. Delicious. I like to pair it up with the sliced pork. So tender. So seasoned. So right. I enjoy the egg drop soup here too. So good I'll have it winter or summer. And during dinner time or after the club, this place never fails. It fills that spot when we tend to feel ravenous. The fortune cookies and orange are also a nice touch before leaving. So at 5am go to your local diner, go to your nearest food truck or just heat up your leftovers. I'll most likely be at Wo- Hop.
1 I had a wonderful meal here with my parents 6 months ago by tonight we had the most unpleasant waiter.  I have never gotten into an argument before but this guy was something else! He gave us all menus in Chinese and I can't read Chinese, so I asked for an English menu.  Everyone was ready to order except for me, so I asked him if I could hold onto the menu and decide later and he refused! He said it would take too long and we are not allowed to add dishes and must decide now.  So I asked him if he has a cold appetizer I remember having last visit and he said no.  He walked away stating we were going to receive three bowls of rice, which I thought was weird bc we didn't ask for any and I thought they came with some dishes anyway.  So then I look through my photos on my phone and find the dish I was referring to and ask to order it and he said no! It's too late! So i got frustrated and he walked away, then another waiter came with the food we ordered and we asked for the dish in the photo and he said sure no problem, I'll add it.  Then we got three bowls of rice and said we didn't want more than 1 bowl because we ordered noodles and the first waiter yelled at us and said "you ordered 3, so you're getting 3!".  I just don't understand how anyone can be that angry, I certainly won't be back.  (I wouldn't be so bothered with the service if I had many heard how polite and patient the same waiter was with a group of tourists sitting behind us, let them keep a menu, asked them how many bowls of rice they wanted, let them add additional dishes, etc) not cool!
4 Chinese food the way I remembered it. It's like going to a dive bar. The spare ribs were the best I had in this style. I loved the pork fried rice and the boiled pork shrimp dumplings. They also don't make wonton soup like this anymore. There's two Wo Hops on the block. Make sure you go to the one downstairs. That's where the chef is!
2 WHY WE WENT HERE: - apparently Wo Hop is THE go-to spot for Chinese food in NYC?  - we were relatively in the area after bar-hopping and finishing up at a hookah lounge  THE LOOK (FROM THE OUTSIDE): - located on Mott St in between Mosco St and Worth St - late at night, the entrance is toward downstairs  THE LOOK (FROM THE INSIDE): - diner-esque - small - lots of fluorescent lighting - pictures of people I don't know all over the walls, along with dollar bills people write on and tape on the walls  THE MENU: - chow mai fon (rice noodles) - hot spicy dishes - special noodles - rice dishes -  chow mein (Canton Style) - beef - pork - seafood - appetizers - soup - lo mein (soft noodles) - chow fon (broad noodles) - fried rice - sweet and pungent - poultry - chow mein - Chinese omelettes - vegetables - Szechuan specialties - Oriental specialties  WHAT WE ORDERED: - fried pork chops with salt and pepper - steamed dumplings - chicken and corn soup - roast duck lo mein - roast pork fried rice  THE TASTE: - my friend felt like this place has never disappointed her and feels this was SUPER bomb Chinese food - to be perfectly honest, I've had WAY better at Chinese spots throughout California (particularly in the Bay Area and San Diego) - I will grant them this, the portions are HUGE  CUSTOMER SERVICE: - the workers were funny and nice
4 If you are looking for late night Chinese food, this is the spot. The service is quick, the food is solid (LARGE portions) and you will surely be surrounded by a very young crowd who likely left the bar at the same time you did.  You can never go wrong with the fried rice, general tao and lo mein. Definitely satisfying (in the moment). Good for those living in the LES, Financial District and Seaport area.
5 AMAZING. REAL CHINESE FOOD! You won't find any better. Don't let it being inside of a basement fool you. The staff here is really welcoming and friendly too!
5 I absolutely love this place! It's not fancy by any means but service is good and prices and portions are fair. Also open super late maybe 24 hours not sure but def a good spot to sober up after the bar.
3 I'm not a big Chinese food guy (keep that in mind). The place is small and well known, open 24 hours. I had the friend shrimp & dumplings for app. All decent. Then the wo hop lo mein for dinner; it squid, chicken, beef and shrimp with noodles and a sauce. It was soaked in the sauce and I wasn't too crazy over it. What saved it, was my date ordered roasted pork chow fun. It was good, not too saucy. Decent place
4 met a friend for lunch the other day and decided to eat at one of my favorite old time restaurants in chinatown. i have been going to wo hop since the bad times and i am happy to say that the food remains consistent and good. started with a wonton soup, couple of egg rolls, fried wontons, order of roast pork, beef young sing chow fun and pineapple chicken. chinese food perfection. i tend to like the upstairs more than the downstairs. while hong fat has faded into oblivion i am thrilled to report that wo hop rolls on.
5 If your looking for good Chinese food at a fair price in NYC and don't need it fancy, this is your place. Fast, authentic, open late  and delicious.
4 This was my first time having Chinese food from New York and i can say that this place has the tastiest shrimp fried rice!! Ate it so fast that i didnt even have time to take a picture of the dish. We also had Lo Mein and that was also pretty good. The food came out pretty quick and i didn't even have to wait long . I will definitely come back here!
2 Was once our go to place; hasn't been for awhile. Food is average, staff not attentive or the friendliest. Could be cleaner. Open late.
4 OK, the verdict is on, the original basement downstairs is better than the upstairs restaurant but this place has more space and more asian eaters. I find most sauces are leaning toward a sweet taste. I also believe that Asians eat here because of the round tables that they provide. This gives an option to have a family style dining experience or Asian style, where you order many different dishes and share. We ordered some razor clam, which is Hubby's favorite. Another dish we picked is shrimp and vegetable. Both dishes were still very good but the original Wo Hop is the King!
3 Bad NY-style Americanized Chinese food. I like Americanized Chinese as well as the authentic stuff; I'm no "real" Chinese food snob. But this is inferior for this type of food. Not worth going to except when everything else is closed. 2 stars, plus an extra star for being open 24 hours. Still better than most Chinese in California. Fuck Nutrition House for saying they're the only 24-hour Chinese restaurant in the United States, when this place got there *69 years* sooner.
5 this place is awesome. There is a line, but it moves, and you might have to share a table with another couple, but they are my favorite Chinese restaurant for date night.
5 So authentic. The place is what real NYC Chinese food is supposed to taste like. Check out the photos I posted. So good.
5 Love wo hop , they will Make old style chicken chow mein with crisp thin noodles buried below the enormous stack of steaming hot chow mein , egg rolls are perfect and not greasy . Egg drop soup was perfect with the right amount of egg and the fried rice is like hibachi style . Service is superb as you have several servers  instantly filling your water and tea glasses . Will return every time I'm in the city
5 Spectacular. Salt & pepper shrimp are awesome, or soft shell crabs if they are in season.  Dumplings are amazing. Please do not confuse with restaurant next door. Accept no imitations.
5 So I love chinese food. but NEW YORK city has chinese food like no where else. I must say I ate this please for the first time, with my husband on a trip to ny ( his first time to NY) and I was blown out of the water, this please is not even normal. Yes Yes I understand that most of the food is not healthy! but when I eat here the only thing I can think of is, I have to live my life and eat what makes me happy lol life is short and this is what makes me happy! the Pork fried rice is like BAM and the egg foo young was also a hit! but i must say that they gave me a sauce, but it was a black greasy sauce, with floating jalapenos. BUT it was NOT normal i am smarter then to ask what in it.   so all in all, wait in the 15 deep line to get a seat it soooo worth it!! BOMB
5 Authentic and amazing real deal Chinese food. I eat here any time I can, not just after a night of drinking (but it's most fun at night when its packed and crazy)
1 This is my second time visiting this restaurant and believe me when I say that the second time WAS NOT a charm. The service was terrible and my waiter had a very nasty attitude. It almost feel like I didn't exist to them. My food was thrown to me on the table and a pitcher of water was left for me on the table. As I look around, no other table have a pitcher instead the waiters are constantly servicing the customers. I am the only black person in here and I feel a bit profiled. I WILL NEVER COME BACK HERE AGAIN.
2 Been here twice and felt that the food was sub-par - mostly Americanized Chinese food.  First time I went was during weekday night, and there was quite some wait. I think I waited 30 minutes. I ordered the Mapo Tofu, and it wasn't really Mapo Tofu: barely any ground pork, too much other types of veggies, hot & sauce wasn't spicy.. Heck, sauce wasn't even right, and tofu wasn't the fresh young type of tofu that Mapo Tofu is supposed to come with.  Second visit i had the chicken fried rice togo. Even though it smelled good, the fried rice wasn't good. I had had much better fried rice elsewhere.  CASH ONLY too.
2 If you are looking for authentic Cantonese food that taste delicious, don't come here. What we have here is an old Chinatown relic that was serving Chinese food that Chinese workers working in the area used to eat. It isn't gourmet or even good and doesn't justify its relatively higher prices compared to other places for lunch.  Come here only if other places around are closed and you want something to settle your stomach after an alcoholic binge or if you want some nostalgia because you were fed bad Chinese food while growing up.
3 Best egg rolls my boyfriend and I have ever had. The food was good but not outstanding by any means, little salty. The service was good. Cool place
4 I'm always looking for a new place to try out...especially in Chinatown where you can find some authentic Asian food for cheap prices. A friend of mine suggested that we go here one day when we were hanging out and shopping and he mentioned how amazing the place was... Apparently his parents used to bring him here a lot when he was a kid so there's also Nostalgia attached. There's more than one location apparently right next door to one another but the one we went to was the original which is essentially in a basement. I had high hopes, given the location since I live dive locations with great food and hopefully decent prices.  Unfortunately, the food was just ...good. Nothing memorable or worth going out of the way to revisit for... I had the cold sesame noodles and chicken fried rice and my friend had a more elaborate entree and he even ordered some stuff to go because he loves it so much. Obviously it's nice to know that food is consistently good and a given location but there's definitely nothing extraordinary that I feel the need to recommend this place. The service was just ok, the food was good... And since it's cramped they are definitely pressuring you to get out as soon as you're done so they can make room for the next group of people to come in. It seems as though there's always people coming in and out I'm sure there's a sense of nostalgia in others like my friend. They even have pictures of famous people eating there... So feel free to check it out but they're definitely better places in Chinatown and in the city!
2 So i literally just left . I came from long island after being told this is the best chinese food ever .. well i basically wasted my time. So after i got my bill I realized i paid for items i never even received. I also found a paper fortune in my fried rice . And the general tsos tasted like chicken that was thrown in the fryer and tossed in a flavorless watered down sauce . And then got called cheap for leaving a $5 tip . Well maybe if the food and service lived up to the hype they would of gotten more .
4 The food is definitely westernized but they didn't prepare the food in a way which loses the taste of Canton way too much. Pretty good for the portion and size. And it opens 24hours.
5 One of the last places still around since my childhood in the 70's. I've been going there most of the time when I worked locally off of Chambers street. But, now I live in Houston and visit my hometown 2-3 times a year and still make it a point to visit the Wo.  It's a reminder of what makes NYC a great place to visit. I can't say I love all the plates but I do have faves that I can't find anywhere else.  This place is tops in my opinion and still has my respect. Keep it up guys.
4 One of the last classic restaurants left in Chinatown. Been coming here for over a decade and still a hit.
4 Not being from the city I did not realize this place was an institution. But as soon as we went downstairs and got seated and started looking around you can see this place has been here a long long time. Wait time on a Saturday mid afternoon was relatively short. 10 minutes maybe.   We got steamed dumplings, ginger and scallion lo mein and Cantonese lobster because a couple of older ladies in line who have been coming here for years said that was their favorite dish. Getting the lobster ensured that this was not going to be a super cheap meal. I don't think I'd get the lobster again because while it was pretty good, it was a lot of work and mess.   That said everything we had was very good. Not the best Chinese food I've ever had but really good in a cool atmosphere.
4 It's a small hole in the wall authentic Chinese restaurant in China town. Food quality was top notch. The wait staff are a little sarcastic stern old country Chinese but that's what you get in a real Chinese restaurant! Definitely return for the food.
2 Nice place to go for a late night or early morning meal since they are open 24 hours. I've only been to the upstairs restaurant before but it seems like from the yelp reviews that the downstairs (basement) restaurant may serve better food. The food and selection are mediocre at best by Chinatown standards but if your used to eating at your local neighborhood takeout place you may be wowed. The prices vary from bargain dishes to mid-range $$. At least the English menu caters more towards Chinese-American tastes than authentic Chinese tastes. I stopped by at 4:30am one-time for a quick bite. I ordered the Shrimp with Chinese vegetables over rice for $6.50 (bargain price). The rice was cold, dry and crusty like it had been sitting at the bottom of the pot for hours. Rest of the dish was below average. Might be better to order a noodle dish during the off hours. I've had regular dinner here a couple of times but would not recommend coming here for a regular dinner. It is a bit pricey for the quality of the food, lack of service excellence/ambiance and lack of authenticity. The clams with black bean sauce, beef with asparagus, and spinach with garlic are decent. The steamed sea bass (tasted like frozen fish), steamed pork dumplings and chicken with pork dumplings soup (dumplings are too doughy) were below par. They give u a free pot of tea and ice water. Bathroom is downstairs and clean. This place is mostly a place for non-Asians since they speak better English than most Chinatown restaurants and their menu mainly caters to Chinese-American tastes. Service is a bit impatient and robotic. Good place to eat for a late night meal (after the better choices are closed) or quick takeout for a rice or noodle dish.
3 I guess I had high expectations for this place. It's sort of famous, and it's been recommended to me by numerous people. Will have has an upstairs, and an underground location. I was told the food underground has bigger portions and it's tastier. Where is the food at the aboveground restaurant is more of a "tourist location." The first time I went I waited in line for over 45 minutes just to get into this very tiny packed restaurant it did have a very cool feel, the walls are covered and pictures and dollar bills, the restaurant is so tiny you're practically sitting in your neighbors table, but in a good way. However I wasn't super impressed with the food. Chinese food is so delicious! And I was expecting some of the best Chinese food I've ever had, however, it was definitely not some of the better Chinese food I've tasted. I've now been there 3 times, and the third time was the best, but over all, I'm not overly impressed with the food here. Still a cute spot, open 24 hours and good enough, especially at 4am :)
5 Regarding the classic westernized menu, this is the real deal going out for Chinese in NYC experience. Menu had all the classic choices and the quantities upon order were ginormous. And if you're a wonton soup fan and miss what wonton should really be like. Order the roast pork wonton. Incredibly good!
5 I wish I could say this is a hidden gem but I'm sure most foodies know about this place.
5 There is ALWAYS a line for Who Hop. It is worth the wait for downstairs. After living in NYC my whole life...The consensus is downstairs is better. Its amazing americanized Chinese food...Don't expect authentic. The Chicken Kow w/ Black Bean Sauce is BOMB I get it everytime I go. Chow fun is excellent and the eggfoyung (sp) is great too! The fried dumplings are a must try as well.
5 4.6 Great take-out spot open all night Have to walk downstairs You can dine in and get the usual restaurant service in a take-out environment.  Best special lo-mein I've ever had. Everything looks fresh and there's so many toppings that you don't see the noodles when you open the container.  The staff is what you'd expect, in a hurry but still courteous
5 Boom!  The best place for great Chinese food. Lo Mein, Pork wide noodle, hot and sour soup, chicken with green beans. Yummy.
4 A Chinatown classic, Wo Hop is a go-to destination for Americans looking for greasy, great tasting Chinese food. I have been here A LOT with friends and family and we always have a blast! People love this place so much that the line is usually out the door, but like anything else, it really depends on what time you want to eat. Believe me, it is worth the wait regardless!  Besides the fact that all of the food is on the cheaper end of the spectrum, the portions are MASSIVE. If you're coming with a group, this is definitely the type of place that will serve you "family style." That being said, it works out nicely if everyone just shares a couple of dishes rather than each ordering individually, or else look forward to taking home dinner for the next two nights.  Another thing to keep in mind is that if you plan to eat in the downstairs portion of this restaurant, they will not accept credit cards. There is an ATM; however, it charges a $2.50 withdrawal fee.  The one thing that might turn people away is that being a very old establishment, Wo Hop is not exactly the cleanest place to eat in NYC, but for the most part no one seems to care.
3 I used to come here as a child. Maybe it's because of the different kitchens but I felt like upstairs the food was greasiest and full of oil I ordered chow fun and pork fried rice ranting and raving about how good it was to a friend so we ordered take out and everything was the same color. Brown from all the oil. Choose wisely with the upstairs or downstairs and be a picky eater!
4 This place is great. Food is always good! I recommend the salt and pepper pork and the honey crispy chicken.  Service is fast and the staff is friendly.
1 Really bad restaurant.  Do not confuse "Wo Hop City" with "Wo Hop."  Wo Hop City is at 15 Mott Street, and is at street level, and is horrible.  Wo Hop is at 17 Mott Street and is down in the basement, and is wonderful.  Wo Hop City served pathetic garlic shrimp that was flooded with bad brown sauce and hardly any broccoli, just soggy green peppers.  They also served vegetable lo mien that was basically greasy lo mien, hardly any vegetables.  And the vegetable steamed dumplings (which took about 40 minutes to come out of the kitchen), were thick, kind of gummy, and had a strange, almost sweet flavor.  The bathroom is ghastly.
5 Ordered the fried dumplings (do it!!!) with pork fried rice and shrimp egg foo young w/ gravy baby! Everything was delicious and tasted better with duck sauce and soy sauce!   Fast, fair price and yummy! Will definitely be back again!
4 I come here all the time with my kids and friend. Real Chinese like no other place you've eaten. Yum A must try!!
4 This is a little gem in Chinatown.  Located in the basement and with very limited sitting.  The food is great and the prices are awesome!   I had the beef Chow Fun and it was very delicious although a bit oily for me.  I had to order steamed vegetables on the side to mix it up.  But it was really delicious and a great value.  I want to try other things on the menu.  I am certainly going back for more.
2 Prior to moving to Long Island, Wo Hop was a late night favorite of this City girl.  So, when I found myself in China Town yesterday (a rare sunny-60 degree February afternoon), I naturally decided to stop in for some takeout.  (on top floor)     While I waited, I noted the place hadn't changed.  Same blast-from-the-past vinyl booths, and same dirty floor tiles that appear to have been estranged from a mop for quite some time.  I quickly diverted my eyes to the front door to check out their Health Dept. rating (and "A", whew!) which provided some comfort believing the kitchen must be cleaner.    Once back to our hotel, we eagerly opened all the little white boxes in anticipation of the "best Chinese food in NYC."    Sigh... the build-up did not meet the reality.   Were the daytime cooks just not as skilled as those preparing our meals at night?... or, perhaps (more likely) it tasted better in the past because our late night snack had followed an evening imbibing adult beverages.  Whatever the reason, this time, dumplings were greasy and over-cooked;  LoMein was dark in color, swimming in soy sauce, and thus, way too salty.   Roast Pork Fried Rice was equally heavy on the soy sauce, and unfortunately, light on pork.   Needle in a haystack when you found a piece.    The old adage, "all good things must come to an end" comes to mind today as I write.   I don't see myself going back there.   The end of an era.   (Sniff)
2 I absolutely can eat Chinese food for breakfast lunch and dinner and luckily this place is 24/7.    I have to say the food was mediocre and I would rather order from my local Chinese take out place back in NJ.  The best item from our entree was the 1/2 roasted duck. We ordered beef and snow peas in oyster sauce but the beef was so chewy, I had to swallow it whole. The sesame chicken was drenched in sauce and the broccoli tasted fishy.  What's nice is that they ended the meal with sliced oranges and fortune cookie. As always complimentary mediocre tea as well. I'll pass on this place next time.
5 Dig that they are open 24 hours. Pork fried rice, ribs and general tso's chicken were all tasty and shareable. Strong, hot tea served in glasses was good too. Ask for the chili oil if you like spice. Worth a try if you're in the neighborhood.
3 Walk down a flight of stairs into the restaurant. Cash only. Small restaurant. Place is really cool. There are dollars on the wall. Place is definitely unique!! No scallion pancakes ...  I know how strange. Anyhow, I ordered egg rolls, fried rice, chicken and broccoli, and Lo mein. Food was good. Service is pushy. You have to order fast. Felt rushed and disrespected. Would I go again? I don't think so. Nothing special besides dollar bills on the wall and no scallion pancakes AND no vegetable dumplings.
3 Wo Hop has taken MSG in Chinese food to a whole new level! Their Chinese food has practically been pumped full of steroid-esq MSG. Don't get me wrong - it's a flavor enhancer and helps make the food taste amazing but wow your body might regret it the next morning.   Overall the vibe is very cool with all the dollar bills posted on all the walls and the scene is quite the ruckus with an extremely diverse clientele (from couples on dates to the super hipster folks).   It's annoying that they're cash only - but that's probably how they got all the dollar bills on the wall.   The service was also a little pushy and tried to hustle us out (granted we were 3 people sitting at a table for 6, so makes sense given there was a long wait to get seated).
5 Open til the wee hours! Can't go wrong with that!  If you need a late night Chinese food fix, this is your place.  Ask for a cup of tea while you wait, it's very soothing.  I always order the Singapore style Chow Mei Fun. The lemon chicken is also great!  Definitely recommend this place!
4 This place was recommended by a local and we almost skipped it because of the sketchy location. Definitely some of the best, authentic Chinese food we have ever had. The staff wasn't unfriendly but indifferent and service was fast. Worth a try.
5 Chinese beer 100% Salt and pepper calamari love this place. There is hinestly nothing like downstairs.
4 Always great comfort food at any hour, razor clams & snails  are always good, sometimes they're out because they only carry the freshest ingredients. The staff is hilarious and accommodating. An staple in Chinatown.
4 LOL - Oh Garsh. So many haters. Soooooo, some dishes in a Chinese restaurant in a basement on Mott Street can be a little greasy? Who would have thunk?? I've been coming here for 40 years. Stick to basics people. Dumplings are of the thicker variety so, forewarned. Good egg and spring rolls. Very good Peking Duck. BEST roast duck chow fun in the city - huge pieces of duck. Any Chow Fun works here. Shrimp with black bean sauce (get the small shrimp). Chicken in black bean sauce (get the sliced chicken, not breaded). Roast pork w/string beans. If you're from Indiana, or Brooklyn, and insist on ordering Lo Mein, get the roast pork, it will be tastier than the chicken. Keep it simple. If you're going to get esoteric - DON'T!! Wait until you can afford Redfarm or Decoy to get esoteric. Sheesh
4 Old school New York Chinese food. It's like a greasy spoon diner atmosphere with great Chinese food and diner style service the tea and water was on the table before you get your coat off!
4 OMG SOOOOOOOOOOOOO GOOD! I was wandering down Mott, trying to find a place to eat. Two adorable grandmothers who were out shopping practically dragged me and my friends down the street to this place. It doesn't look like much but the food was amazing. I had two bowls of their hot and sour soup. I just spent an hour on Google Maps trying to locate this place again so I can go back. Yum!
5 Best Chinese restaurant that I've ever had. Wife's family took me there after years of telling me about the mystical Wo Hop. Had their shrimp and black bean sauce, lo mein, wonton soup, egg rolls and it was all delicious. We stood in the stairwell for close to 30 minutes and it was totally worth it. Cannot wait to go back as soon as we can.
5 Quick service and good food.The general tso's chicken is great and I like a lot of the other dishes great for 2 people.They are nice and let you have a nice meal and conversation.Good prices for good food.
5 I've been coming here for years ever since attending graduate school and working in Manhattan.  Now I live elsewhere but return whenever I can.  Never had anything bad here.  Everything's been perfect...always.
4 The hard-working staff who work there were so fantastic to me and my friends, along with the lively atmosphere.  So welcoming on either upstairs or downstairs floors, late Friday night.  Their food was great on top of that.  I had the chicken black beans and pepper broad noodles dish, and fried dumplings, which were both great. My friends' told me their dishes were great as well.
4 the only & best place to have great old school classic chinese food. i grew up as a kid coming here, always same great food. if in new york come to wo hop
4 This restaurant was amazing besides the wait it's totally worth it we ordered chow fon 4d which was a bit oily but delicious and I hope you all go try this place out!!!
2 American-Chinese fare in the middle of Chinatown. Overpriced for what it is, and I feel like your local Chinese restaurant in the middle of [insert random area] would be a better price point and quality of food.
2 It's basically a take-out restaurant that you can sit and eat in at 3am when you're a hipster and drunk and hungry af...  Food quality is poor, the grease makes you feel sick, I was the only Chinese person in this Chinese spot. (Think about how strange that is in Chinatown) BUT it is a fun environment and the food comes out quickly.
5 This is my family "spot." We come here every time the family gets together in the city. We've been coming for years...for a reason. The food is absolutely amazing! Be prepared to wait a little though. I've never been there without waiting. It has that "hole in the wall" type of feel but this place is very well known. Bring cash.
2 Maybe I've been ordering the wrong things, but I just have not had good experiences with Wo Hop.  It's not that I need it to be fancy.  For example, I think Hop Kee next door is great.  But, when it comes down to it, the food I had just wasn't good.  In particular, the roast pork was just really bad. I was expecting to to be like char siu, but it was just dry, tough slices of pork soaked in soy sauce.  The other appetizers I had (all deep fried American Chinese stand-bys) were Ok, but nothing special.  The only thing I can think of that is special about Wo Hop is just that it's open crazy late and that it's been around forever.
5 Food r great and best hour operation everrr!!! The most clean Chinese restaurant in Chinatown New York zBest Chinese restaurant service everrrrr!! Me and my bf love Wong ask for him super friendly.. love sautéed  little next clams , sautéed  lobster with ginger scallion, little snails r delicious ... loving it and love u wongggggg
4 Open 24 hours and has quality food. That in itself is worth 5 stars. I knocked it to a 4 because the Duck in my fried rice was all fat and no meat. Their lobster sauce was also too gelatinous, but still tasted great. As much as I want to love the authentic stuff, their general tsos chicken was awesome.
1 This place gets no stars. Food was not good at all. I found a roach just hanging around. Not worth the trip or money
5 Food is amazing. This place is a staple every time I'm in downtown Manhattan. Price is on par with the food quality and portion. Service is excellent.   Amazing!
5 Wo Hop has some of the best Cantonese style food in town! That being said, make sure you pick the right area to eat. Not to be confused with Wo Hop on 17 Mott Street, these are vastly different restaurants. The first level restaurant of Wo Hop on 15 Mott delivers delicious Cantonese style food. The basement downstairs portion is good for Americanized greasier late-night dining.   Sure Wo Hop City is a no frills, Chinese-brusqueness style of dining. But the food on the first floor is a crowd pleaser. And with most Chinese restaurants in any of the 3 Chinatowns, its better to come with a large group and order from the set menus. The food tends to be better and the service usually vastly improves.  I've had some wonderful family dinners here with my grandma, uncles, aunts and parents.  We shared springy chilled white jellyfish, dishes of fried crunchy walnuts with crispy jumbo shrimp, crisp savory conch, and spicy garlic sautéed sea snails. We enjoyed fried Cantonese chicken, hot pot of tofu with plentiful squid, bok choy and perfectly coated with gravy. We've split fried tofu with shrimp stuffing and hot clay pots of silky tenderized pork and tofu.   I've seen picky family members smiling and nodding through the meal. And when asked if they enjoyed their food, they had no complaints! Now that is an amazing feat.    I've also enjoyed great lunches with friends. I've had many good memories here. I hope Wo Hop City continues to deliver delicious Cantonese food in Chinatown!
